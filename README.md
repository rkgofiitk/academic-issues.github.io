# Academic Issues in Indian Higher Education System

This series of blogs reflects my opinion on some contemporary issues that beset the Higher Education system in India. As a professor in one of the leading 
Technical Institutions in India, I had the opportunity to observe and experience many twists and turns that shaped the Higher Education system in India. Most of 
the policy interventions were brought on by the Ministry of Education or Human Resources. However, government interventions were supported by a set of educators who 
were close to politicians in power. Technical education is, by and large, apolitical because of its inherent characteristics. Yet, the availability of state-of-the-art 
technology spells troubles for political establishments as people may use technology to destabilize established political dispensation. Information flow is a major 
contributor to mass-based upheavals in the governance of the state's writs. So, the Ministry of Education is crucial for any system of governance. From time to time, the government 
comes up with an intervention to correct the educators and support those in power. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the implications of specific 
policies from a neutral viewpoint.
