This series of blogs reflects my opinion on the issues that beset Higher Education System in India. The primary
focus is on Technical Education. An alert observer will point out that a country's progress depends not only
on technical education. However, a country's GDP development depends primarily on research innovation in all areas,
including agriculture, healthcare, industrial outputs, logistics, transport infrastructure, supply chain management,
finance, investment infrastructure, and many more. Innovation in any of the mentioned areas depends on
a strong foundation of technical education. I am not discounting the critical role of humanities and social sciences.
However, I am not an expert in the field and have yet to do the research needed to express
opinions. Placing a toe-hold in a creative area like fine arts, sculptures, sociology, psychology, or philosophy requires 
many years of foundational studies. There are enough bloggers in the creative fields who would do a better job than I could.
