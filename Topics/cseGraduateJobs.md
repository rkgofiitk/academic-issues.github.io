# Raising Employment Opportunities for CSE Graduates.

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Indian universities offer many different academic programs in the general area of computer science and its application. B. Tech in Computer Science & Engineering is the most standardized among these. Many institutions also offer MCA (Master in Computer Applications). The MCA syllabus emphasizes teaching programming skills with a fair amount of accounting and some training in business management. Some universities also offer BCA, BSc, and MSc courses in computer science. However, except for IITs and a few IIITs and CFTIs, most institutions produce nonemployable graduates.

There are three main reasons for most Indian universities producing unemployable CSE graduates:

- They admit students with no background for their courses,
- They recruit low-quality teaching faculty, and
- They don't have adequate resources to offer such courses.

As a result, the CSE students from most universities end up looking for placement offers long ater their graduation. Most job seekers have no option but to enroll themselves for additional training in so-called "finishing schools." Finishing schools are intermediaries who may have ties-ups with employers and run head-hunting operations.  

Software companies like Infosys TCS, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra have in-house training centers. These companies do not care about what the students learn during their graduate studies. They typically look for the background and general perception of the university's standing. Essentially, the recruiters look for intrinsic capabilities of a candidate to learn and adapt to a job's challenges. Infosys runs a very big training center at Mysore that trains 10,000 freshers. Most Indian software companies have rigorous training programs. A fresher is asked to quit if she cannot complete the training program.  

Using intermediaries for training allows the recruiters to avoid many legal problems in avoiding unwanted recruitments and maintaining in-house training centers. In summary, Indian universities have survived with producing unemployable graduates in Computer Science because of in-house training of freshers. Universities function as clearing houses for degree certificates. The whole echo system of educating and training students in programming skills is thriving due to poor university regulatory structure and incompetent teaching faculty of the affiliating university.  

Most freshers from state or private universities have never written 100 lines of C code. Coding requires patience and concentration. My experience tells me that unless forced, most students 
would avoid writing codes. There is a general tendency to lift codes for assignments from 
different sources, including copying code from a batch mate. We have to use MOSS or Turnitin to 
check for the originality of the code. Initially, I found that 80% of the students copied their coding 
assignments from the batch mates. I think most teaching faculty elsewhere and even in IITs
don't consider policing students is not their job, and rightly so. We took extra care to ensure
that our undergraduates are the best employable graduates in the market.
Sometime back, we interviewed a candidate for a teaching post at NIT Durgapur. We found that the candidate had no clue about basic C programming syntax, though he claimed to have written complex C programs for the experiments related to his thesis. Often, we hear candidates claim to have enough exposure to programming and data structures. However, they were not proficient enough to answer basic questions of linked lists or binary search trees. 

The skill set requirements for a programmer's job have evolved a lot after 2000. The front end is now web-oriented, while the back end depends on cloud technology and high-performance computing. The use of AI and ML has made the backend programming requirement more complicated than ever. Under the changed scenarios, a software developer needs to acquire many different programming skills. Teaching such skills through an academic program is not possible unless we update the syllabus. Furthermore, the syllabus update may be possible only to the extent it makes students better prepared to learn required skills faster. The students can refer to open courseware and other study material available on the Internet, which can be useful for learning skills for DevOps jobs. 


However, alternate routes for learning skills for a job in a software company are expensive. Therefore, upgrading the quality of CSE graduates at the university level is extremely important. AICTE, UGC, NAAC, MeitY, and other regulatory bodies need to wake up and address the issue of universities producing unemployed engineering graduates.
