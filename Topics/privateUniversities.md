## Private Universities in India

[Blog Index](../index.md)

The foundation of Indian univsersity sysetem was laid by the British rulers during the colonial days. The three
universities, one each at Bombay, Madras and Calcutta were established in the year 1857 just before the British rulers faced 
the first spontaneous public protest that colonial historians termed as "the sepoy mutiny". It was not clear if the
universities were established in anticipation of spreading of discontentment among the Indians, or the British rulers
perhaps wanted to create an elite class among Indians who can identify them with colonial rules and further the interest

percentage of well trained graducates will be even less. What bothers me is the way university system is being administered
by state and central govt. First an foremost, VCs are appointed not by their academic accomplishments but by party
affiliations. Therefore, most university VCs were not regarded very highly among teaching faculty. Govt meddling is too

the hands of politicians and bureaucrats. Private universities are even more notorius. They use VCs are rubber stamp and
the management actually calls the shot. I guess of these are happening under knowledge of UGC. UGC cannot bell the cat
