## Moonshining by Software Specialists 

Recently, I came across a news article about Wipro's Rashid Premji berating about moonshining by his staff.
How really moonshines? It wanes for 2 weeks and waxes for 2 weeks! It does not shine always. That is
how solar system works. I am bit surprised by Mr. Premji's take on moonshine. Mr. Azim Premji is touted
to be the largest donor for philanthrophic causes in India. Of course, Mr. Azim Premji belongs to older class
of Indian entrepreneurs being somewhat contemporary to Ratan Tata, Aditya Vikram Birla and Vijaypat Singhania.
The reporters have not sought Mr Azim Premji's views on moonshining. I wonder what would be his views. 
I recently had a discussion with two of my students who have established startups. Both of them are fairly 
well established and come from humble backgrounds. I asked one of them about staff indulging in multiple
assignments with rivals. His views are surprisingly refreshing. He does not care if his staff take up multiple
assignments. He told me that jobs in software industry are project-based. As long as the company's
projects are delivered in schedule, why will the company care about moonshining by the member of the project
team?.  Non-disclosure agreements have fairly stringent clauses and that should take care of the
intellectual property rights. Of course, the poject team leaders have to be little ingenuous in dividing job in a 
manner that the goals of a project is only known to a few core technical experts. So, in my opinion moonshining 
by staff in a software job is no big deal. 

Let us understand who does moonshine being in a regular basis. Probably, there will be no need to 
have departments like ED, CBI, SFIO, EOW, SEBI, etc., if no one does moonshine. Govt servants are The biggest
culprits they seek favors and bribes for performing their duties. Digitization has improved the situation
a lot. CBDT has gone through a real reforms. I had a problem with refund way back in 2009. I had 
written about a dozen representations. Only after 2014, I was able to get the refund directly credited
in my account. Earlier even for a refund of few hundred rupees a class IV staff used to visit us 
and disburse the cheque in exchange of 50% of the amount. Every time I refused to take the refund. We
were careful in calculation of tax so that refund will not exceed beyond a double digit. 

Next bigger cuprit are industry conglomorates. Haven't they formed several companies?
Are n't they directors of several companies?  While talking about one company where they have interest, 
they should look into themselves. They are also moonshining. Many of them are offenders of the highest order.
When ED or CBI or SEBI examines their conduct they cry fouls. The double standard is simply astounding. The media 
never reports about it. They have their own interest. As such most well-known media companies are owned by large
businsess groups. The media reports only when their own interest are not served. 

Health and Education Sectors are most glaring examples where moonshine is rampant. I have come
across a case where a teacher was simultaneously in payrolls of three colleges. I am not sure 
what happened to the person. The guest lecturers are actively espoused by fly by night engineering colleges. 
A person equipped with a mobile phone and mobike could be guest lecturer in multiple colleges in a city. These
"mobile lecturers" have only connection and degrees and offer no technical depth in teaching. As a result students
register only for a degree. That is how India produces a large number of engineers but only 10% are employable. 
The education sector is tatters, and neither the govt nor the regulatory agencies like UGC or AICTE are effective.
People of questionable integrities become Vice-Chancellors. The secretarial staff of the university are more 
powerful than the faculty members. Most private educational institutions are run by corrupt politicians. 

Health sector is tightly controlled by IMA. More student go out of India to get MBBS degrees. About 20K students
were enrolled in Ukrainian unversity before the war borke. About 5k students are admitted to Chinese universities.
In India, fees are simply unaffordable for student who seeks a seat in any private medical school. The powerful
doctors have cartels and exercise control through IMA. It may look like a sweeping statement. But until recently,
things are really bad. It showed up during COVID-19 pandemic. We did not have enough medical staff or doctors.
People died due to unavailability of ventilator, oxygen supply. Unscruplous politicians went to the extent of 
announcing reservation of bed for judges to ward off strictures from the courts.
