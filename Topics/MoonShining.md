## Moonshining in Software Industry 

Recently, I came across a news article about Wipro's Rashid Premji berating about moonshining by his staff.
How does the moon shine? It wanes for two weeks and waxes for two weeks. It never shines all the time. That is
how the solar system works. I am a bit surprised by the younger Premji's take on moonshine. The popular perception is 
Mr. Azim Premji is the largest donor to philanthropic causes in India. Of course, Mr. Azim Hashim Premji belongs to the
older generation of Indian entrepreneurs. He donated 34% of his Wipro shares to Azim Premji Foundation in 2019. The 
article did not discuss Mr. Azim Premji's views on moonshining by his employees. I wonder what his views would be. 

In this context, I recently discussed with two of my students who have done well with their software startup ventures. 
Both of them come from pretty humble backgrounds. I asked one of them about his views on the staff 
indulging in multiple assignments with rivals. His views are surprisingly refreshing and forward-looking. He does
not care as long as his delivery schedule remains unaffected. He told me that jobs in the software industry are project-based.
The terms of the contract are reasonably straightforward. If there is a scope for moonshining, let it be. Why will the company
care about it?  Non-disclosure agreements consist of stringent clauses that should take care of 
intellectual property rights. However, the algorithmic logic cannot be caged into a compartment. Of course, the 
replication of the project remains a bit of concern. But only for a limited time. Once used in
a production environment, the goals are out in the public domain. Therefore, for a limited time, the team leaders have to 
be a little ingenuous in partitioning a job so that the goals of a project remain a tightly guarded secret among
a few core technical experts. At some point in time, you need to believe in human relationships.  The student's views are mature and most apt for human management in the software industry.   

I see the problem in a different dimension. Probably, there will be no need to have departments like ED, CBI, SFIO,
EOW, SEBI, etc., if no one does moonshine. Let us first understand who regularly indulges in moonshine.

The politicians and the govt servants are the biggest culprits. They seek favors and bribes for performing their duties. 
Admittedly, digitization has improved the situation a lot. I find CBDT has undergone a fundamental transformation from the
pre-2014 days. I had a problem with a refund of INR 25k way back in 2009. I wrote about a dozen representations, including
CPC office is located in Bangaluru. Only after 2014 did I get the refund directly credited
to my account. Earlier, even for a refund of a few hundred rupees, a minion from ITD  used to visit us 
and disburse the cheque in exchange for 50% of the amount. When confronted, he spilled the bean the entire office
was involved in. Every time I refused to take the refund cheque. We were careful in calculating tax so that refund
would not exceed a double-digit. I guess ITD must have accumulated lakhs of uncashed cheques until 2014. 

The next bigger culprits are industry czars. They form several companies and simultaneously become CEOs, CTOs, directors,
and chairpersons of multiple companies and sometimes use proxies like personal chauffeurs or housekeepers.  The mere 
appearance fee for any meeting may run into lakhs. They do indulge in moonshining as nobody does. Many of them  
are the worst offenders. The nexus with politicians is also rampant in most cases. When ED, CBI, or SEBI examines their 
conduct, they cry fouls. The double standard is simply astounding. The media never cares to report it. They
have their interest.  Most well-known media companies any way are owned by large business groups. The media 
reports only when their interest is not served. 

Judiciary, Health, and Education Depts are other glaring examples. People have the perception that the Judiciary 
is clean. Of course, many judges are clean like many ordinary people are. Most often, when govts are in trouble, they
readily agree to a judicial commission by a retired judge.

The Khosla Commission, the Shah Nawaz Commission,
and the Mukerjee Commission are all investigating the death of Netaji S C Bose in a plane crash in Taiwan en route
to Tokyo. Of course, only Mukerjee Commission was headed by a retired judge. GD Khosla was a bureaucrat and Shanawaz
Khan was a politician. The conclusions of these commissions are in the public domain and none could conclusively answer 
the central question of Netaji's death in a plane crash, instead opened up a lot of new issues. The commission of 
inquiry by retired judges is the most abused form of judicial remedy against potentially explosive public anger. The retired judges
see it as an opportunity to remain in the reckoning and seek multiple extensions of time to file reports. When they
finally file the reports, they favor what the appointing authority wanted them to do. Time is the best healer.
Nobody challenges the brazeness of laundry washing by many retired judges.

IMA tightly controls the health sector. A substantial number of students go out of India to get MBBS degrees. About 20K students
were enrolled in Ukrainian universities before the Russia-Ukrain war broke.  Russian universities enroll about 10k students.
Also, about 5k students are admitted to Chinese universities. In India, fees are simply unaffordable for a student 
who seeks a seat in any private medical school. The influential doctors have cartels and exercise control through IMA.
It may look like a sweeping statement. But until recently, things have been really bad. It showed up in the management of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not have enough medical staff or doctors. People died due to the unavailability of 
ventilators and oxygen supplies. Unscrupulous politicians announced the reservation of beds for
the high court and supreme court judges to ward off judicial strictures against governance. 

In the education sector,  I came across a case where a teacher was simultaneously on the payrolls of three colleges. I 
am not sure what happened to the person. Fly by night engineering colleges actively espouses the guest lecturers for cost cutting. 
A person equipped with a mobile phone and mobile could be a guest lecturer in multiple colleges in a city. These
"mobile lecturers" have only connections and degrees and offer no technical depth in teaching. As a result, students
register only for a degree. That is how India produces many engineers, but only 10% are employable. 
The education sector is in tatters, and neither the govt nor the regulatory agencies like UGC or AICTE are effective.
People of questionable integrities become Vice-Chancellors. The secretarial staff of the university is more 
powerful than the faculty members. Corrupt politicians run most private educational institutions.
