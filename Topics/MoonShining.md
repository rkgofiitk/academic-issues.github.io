## Moonshining by Software Specialists 

Recently, I read a news article about Wipro's Rashid Premji berating about moonshining by his staff.
How really moonshines! It wanes for 2 weeks and waxes for 2 weeks! It does not shine always. That is
how solar system works. I am bit surprised by Mr. Premji's take on moonshine. Azemiji Premji is touted
as largest donor philanthrophist in India. Mr. Azimji belong to old class of Indian entrepreneurs
like Ratan Tata. The reporters have not sought his views on moonshining. But I wonder what would be
his views. I talked to one my students who have established startups. One of them is fairly 
established and comes from a humble background of rural Bihar. His views are surprisingly refreshing.
He says he does not care. The jobs in software industry are project-based. As long as the company's
projects delivered in schedule, why the company will care whether the members of project teams are
engaged in multiple jobs of different companies. Non-disclosure agreements should take care of the
intellectual property rights. Of course, team leaders have to be ingenuous in dividing job in a 
manner the entire project is not quite obvious to any member. So, in my opinion moonshining by staff
even in technical job is not a big deal. 

Let us understand who does moonshine being in a regular job. Probably, there will be no need to 
have departments like ED, CBI, SFIO, EOW, SEBI, etc., if no one does moonshine. The biggest culprits
are industry conglomorates. Take for instance the persons who object to moonshine by employees.
Are n't they directors of several companies? Haven't they formed several companies? While talking
about one company where they have interest, they should look into themselves. They are also 
moonshining. Many of them are offenders of highest order. When ED or CBI or SEBI examines their 
conduct they cry fouls. The double standard is simply astounding. Media never reports about it.
Media has its own interest. It reports only when their own interest are not served. 

Health and Education Sectors are most glaring examples where moonshine is rampant. I have come
across a case where a teacher was simultaneously in payrolls of three colleges. I am not sure 
what happened to the person. Guest lecturers are biggest offender actively espoused by fly by
night engineering colleges. A person equipped with a mobile phone and mobike could be guest 
lecturer in multiple colleges in a city. These mobile lecturers have only connection and degrees
and offer no technical depth in teaching. As a result students register only for a degree. That
is how India produces engineer of which 90% are umemployable. Education sector is shambles, and
no body bothers. People of questionable integrities become Vice-Chancellors. The secretarial
staff of the university are
