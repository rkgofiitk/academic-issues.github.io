##  WhatsApp International University & Distruptive Intervention in Personal Space

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Disruptive communication technology significantly alters the ways of communication and interaction among people. In recent years we witnessed two 
types of disruptive communication systems (i) social networking systems and (ii) Instant messaging systems. Almost
every blog reader must have an account on one social networking site or another. Examples are Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Youtube, and WeChat. Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram are examples of Instant messing systems. Both 
communication technologies are excellent innovations to bring the world closer and allow people to collaborate without
geographical boundaries. The flip side of such disruptive communication has overburdened the already stressed lives of 
ordinary people while app creators, maintainers, promoters are having roaring business along with network service 
providers. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have already started controlling the govt policies worldwide. 
Ukraine seems to be winning over Russia in the ongoing conflict in the e-communication space. Meta has changed its
message posting policies to allow people post abuses targeting the Russian political dispensation and its leaders.
However, this post is not about Ukraine
and Russia conflict. The purpose of the post is to let the readers think about the etiquette of using disruptive 
communication channels. I will draw some analogs from mass media, mainly e-media. 

I remember when the disruptive intervention of Arnab Goswami transformed the Times Now TV news. His only motivation was 
to create a niche for the news transmission on TV from a passive electronic medium like the Radio or Akashvani. Mr.
Goswami became instant <i>bete noire</i> for all news anchors and the people holding leftist views, but TRP of Times Now 
increased tremendously. Mr. Goswami was eventually kicked out of Times Now, and Republic TV came into existence.  
The disruptive news transmission is another example of disruptive 
communication. I do not intend to go into disruptive interventions in TV news anchoring. I want to point out that the 
disruptive interventions created a chasm among people on both sides of the center. The free use of profanities jolted people. But 
eventually, all seasoned political commentators, political parties, and groups developed strong likes or dislikes. 
However, they could not ignore Mr. Goswami while he merrily created his TRP and established Republic TV. We are witnessing increased use of profanities by the politicians and the political commentators from the opposition. 

Having pointed out the importance of disruptive communication, let us focus on Whatsapp or other instant messaging apps. People worldwide
have been dragged into disruptive communication systems by smart end devices (cell phones) and numerous Instant messaging 
apps. There are two sides to any tale. The brighter side is that communication has become easy for the self-employed 
unorganized workforce such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and small artisans. Business communication has turned instant for the 
aggregators' firms. Consumers find it easy to communicate with service providers. However, large business establishments soon learned to use instant 
messaging to create disruptive interventions in personal privacies. I keep getting robot calls during important meetings. It had 
forced me to leave the phone switched off or decline calls. People have to learn to live incommunicado mode to escape the nuisance of disruptive 
intervention in personal space. Blocking numbers does more harm than solving privacy problems. The blocker apps create a database 
of cell numbers and market them with impunity to advertising firms. The nexus is frightening.

However, the most irritations come in trolls and unsolicited knowledge dissemination through Instant messaging systems. I keep 
getting rehashed and recirculated WhatsApp media files every alternate day from unknown sources. I don't know if WhatsApp has a spam filter or how to turn it 
on. It is high time that instant messaging app developers should provide easy ways to kill spam or block specific members of a whatsApp group. Trolls are a big nuisance. A troll 
can make an average person break within a couple of minutes. Usually, the unconnected trollers find it tempting to gang together 
without any reason. It confirms the herd mentality of Animal Firm. Sometimes, people who don't have anything to do with the issue 
start commenting.

I have to subscribe to a large WhatsApp group where people seem to have a view on every damn thing from a toothbrush to broom, Kashmir 
to Gujrat, from Buddha to Confucius, from Chanakya to Machiavelli. I fondly call them Professors of WIU (WhatsApp International 
University). But honestly, the quality of posts does not show that the academic excellence of the nation has increased one bit. 
Instead, the use of profanities in public discourse has increased tremendously. You may get 1000 messages if you ever say anything like Why does the sky looks 
blue today? or "Why did PM not say something about Ukraine Russia conflict?"

An average person may not understand the Russia-Ukraine conflict except for being hassled by the price
inflation due to the disruption in supply of oil and gas. So, it does not make sense why an average person should target the abuses of Putin or 
Zelensky, or Biden or NATO. The flood of whatsApp messaging on the conflict is just irrelevant digital garbage. 

The other notable whatsApp digital filth is the rampant use of greetings like good morning, good evening, or even
"international day of morons." It makes us wonder if God has suddenly decided to bestow everyone with happiness, and the
world has become flat with happiness. Yet hatred, spewing venom on Twitter becomes essential. Some 
"influencers" get paid by the groups seeking to create trouble. The business of dirt and gossip is just mind-boggling. 
Only one thing that comes to my mind is that "filth of any kind sells, even in digital space." Unmindful of personal privacy, people ogle at the digital 
filth and actively participate in making the filth stink more and more. If they expose themselves to privacy invasion, profiling becomes 
simple due to digital footprints. AI, ML, and Data Science gain importance over foundational technologies.
