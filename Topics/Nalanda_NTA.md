# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of 19th June 2024 were academically more significant than in the last five 
years. The first is the Nalanda Campus, inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Kumar Gupta 
established Nalanda University in the 14th century. It was hailed as the finest citadel of learning 
in the oriental world. Aryabhat invented the concept of zero at Nalanda University, revolutionizing
mathematics and scientific studies. The Nalanda University excelled in all branches of science 
and liberal arts. Over 10k students from around the world studied at Nalanda. The university's scholars
served as knowledge reservoirs of knowledge and propelled some of the most significant 
cognitive discoveries of the time. It had disciplines like mathematics, astrophysics, and medical 
sciences. The Turkish-origin Muslim invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji destroyed the university and set its 
famous library on fire. However, this post is not about the destruction of Nalanda; there are many
accounts of the burning of Nalanda University's library in history books and the massacre of its
scholars and students. Some excellent videos on the topic are available on YouTube. I wish to 
restrict myself to India's quest to reclaim the venerable legacy of erstwhile Nalanda University.

The new Nalanda University and its ultra-modern campus in Rajgir were funded by the cooperative 
efforts of ten countries in the East Asia Summit (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, 
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) along with Australia, China, India, Japan, 
New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States. The first VC was an 
associate professor of Lady Sriram College's Sociology Dept. However, the Nobel laureate Amartya
Sen held the post of the university's first Chancellor and Chief Mentor
for nine years between 2010-2019. Prof Sen was associated with the university on an 
honorary basis. During its 14 years, the university did not even cause a localized whirlwind with the
assemblage and the association of the world's famous authors, economists, thinkers, and historians. 
It is something of a concern. Surprisingly, the government of the day (headed by
another acclaimed economist, Dr. Manmohan Singh), the Chancellor, and the Vice-Chancellor, with
all their wise men and women, did not think of establishing science and engineering depts in 
the university. IMHO, it is difficult to visualize a world-class university for liberal arts without
a mathematics dept! Maybe one of the three or all three may be correct:

- The mathematicians did not believe in Nalanda's glorious past or
- Those who believed in Nalanda's past thought it was an unrealizable dream or 
- The university's policy framer did not consider mathematics's importance.

I wonder what kind of purpose an exclusive liberal arts university may serve in today's world. I am not 
denigrating studies of social sciences. However, institutions of social sciences are, at best, small
single-unit universities with low enrollments. Therefore, splurging INR 1800 crores for a campus of 
such a university (with only an enrollment of 400 odd students) appears to be a pure extravaganza,
especially when a government is struggling even to ensure equal opportunities for medical sciences
to its aspiring young citizens. 

The country needs good doctors and many of them. About 2.3 million students sit for the NEET test. 
We can train at least 0.1 million (approx. 4%) of them to become doctors, if not more. 
Except for a few institutions like ISI, CMI, and IITs, teaching mathematics in statistics in India
is abysmal. It is possible also to train at least 0.1 million students to become better mathematicians,
statisticians, and data scientists. Human resources is critical for a country to become a
powerhouse of ideas and innovations. Unless the government invests heavily in the development of 
human resources, it will remain a nation of traders and service providers.

The second event of 19th June is the scrapping of the UGC-NET test by the Education Ministry. NTA 
now faces a severe existential threat as a credible national test agency. The UGC-NET question 
papers were available on the dark nets at least 48 hours before the commencement of the test. 
Even the joint CSIR-UGC-NET test scheduled for 25th June is now postponed. IMHO, the education 
mafia is creating havoc in India and putting severe competition to El Chapo or Pablo Escobar. 
IMHO, every such mafioso should be treated as a terrorist, as s/he is attacking the very foundation of 
a nation. Now is the time for the government to consider establishing an NCB to keep regular
tabs on the malpractices in the examination systems of reputed institutions. 

Most private educational trusts were founded or backed by corrupt state-level politicians. 
So, the clamor for handing over NTA-conducted tests to the state should be seen through the lens of 
vested interests. With the active help of corrupt politicians, the education bosses are determined 
to destroy NTA's credibility. It is a diabolical plan to snatch control of entrance tests from
a central agency. The Tamilnadu government has made it clear that NTA's NEET test is against 
the interest of the candidates from the state. Karnataka, Telangana, and other non-BJP-ruled
states have similar views. Even the main opposition party, Congress, supports the devolution of 
the power of conducting eligibility tests at the state level. Ironically, Mr. Kapil Sibal of the 
Manmohan Singh's government propounded the idea of one test. If the control conducting
admission tests is ceded to the states, the education mafia will have a free pass to accommodate
any candidate who approaches them with a heavy purse. At least one right thing is that the breaches 
are getting detected. As I said in my earlier blog, NTA DG Mr Subodh K. Singh has been made a fall
guy and sacked. However, the extent of the breach is yet to be unearthed fully. 
Now that CBI is handling the investigation, we hope the rot in NTA will be exposed to the public. 
However, I wonder if the government wants the public to believe preventing question paper leakage 
is rocket science! The indicator is the appointment of a high-power expert committee to examine
NEET scam chaired by ex-ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan. IMHO, education should be free from any politics.

Let me wrap up this post with a few remarks about NEET 2024. 

- Outsourcing the investigation of the fiasco to the apex court is incorrect.
- The court may adjudicate on long-term legal and ethical issues related to the conduct of tests.
- It will be unfair to thousands of successful candidates if a retest is ordered.
- Retest is an option if large-scale leakage has occurred.
- The real challenge would be to localize the leakage-affected areas and hold a retest.
- The activities of coaching centers should be monitored regularly as a preventive measure. 
- A lifetime ban with heavy penalties should be imposed on politicians and operators involved in the leakage issue.
- An NCB-type education scam control bureau should be established. 

Many of the points mentioned above would take a lot of work to implement as they may involve 
infringement of privacy issues. But desperate situations demand desperate measures.
