# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of the day 19th of June, 2024, were academically hot, as were the long summer days, and the 
mercury hit over 50 degrees Celsius in the northern parts of India. The first is the Nalanda Campus, 
inaugurated by the Prime Minister at Rajgir, Bihar. Kumar Gupta established Nalanda University in the 
14th century. It was hailed as the finest citadel of learning in the oriental world. Aryabhat 
invented the concept of zero at Nalanda University. The university excelled in all branches of science 
and liberal arts. Over 10k students from around the world studied at Nalanda. The university's scholars
served as knowledge contributors of the highest caliber and propelled some of the most significant 
cognitive discoveries of the time. It had disciplines like mathematics, astrophysics, and medical 
sciences. The Turkish-origin Muslim invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji destroyed the university and set its 
library on fire. However, this post is not about how Nalanda was destroyed; there are many accounts of 
the burning of Nalanda University's library in history books and the massacre of its scholars and 
students. Some excellent videos on the topic are available on YouTube. I wish to restrict myself to 
India's quest to reclaim the venerable legacy of erstwhile Nalanda University.

The modern campus of Nalanda University was funded by cooperative efforts of ten countries in the east
Asia Summit (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand, Vietnam) along with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, 
Russia and the United States. The first VC was a person of the university who was an associate 
professor of Lady Sriram College's Sociology Dept. However, the university's Chancellor and Chief Mentor
were Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Apparently, Prof Sen was associated with the university on an 
honorary basis for nine years. During its 14 years, the university did not cause 
a localized whirlwind with assemblage and association of the world's famous authors, thinkers, and
historians. It is something that is a matter of concern. Surprisingly, the government
of the day, the Chancellor, and the Vice-Chancellor, with all their men and women, did not think of
establishing science and engineering depts in the university. It is difficult to visualize a 
world-class university for liberal arts without a mathematics dept! Perhaps the mathematicians did 
not foresee Nalanda's glorious past would ever be realizable through a revival plan, or the university 
did not even approach them. I wonder what kind of purpose an exclusive liberal arts university may serve
in today's world. I am not denigrating studies of social sciences. However, 
institutions of social sciences are, at best, small single-unit universities with low enrollments. 
Therefore, splurging INR 1800 crores for a campus of such a university with only 400 odd students
appears to be a pure extravaganza, especially when a government is struggling even to ensure equal
opportunities for medical sciences to its aspiring young citizens. 

The country needs good doctors and many of them. About 2.3 million students sit for the NEET test. I 
think at least 0.1 million (<5%) of them could be trained to become doctors, if not more. 
Except for a few institutions like ISI, CMI, and IITs, teaching mathematics in statistics in India
is abysmal. We could train at least 0.1 million students to become better mathematicians,
statisticians, or data scientists. Human resources is critical for a country to become a
powerhouse of ideas and innovations. Unless the government invests in human resource
development, it will remain in the never-ending loop of traders and service providers.

The second event is the scrapping of the UGC-NET test by the Education Ministry. NTA now faces a severe 
existential threat as a credible national test agency. The NET question papers were 
available on the dark nets before the test. IMHO, the Education Mafiaso is creating havoc in India and 
putting severe competition to El Chapo or Pablo Escobar. IMHO, these mafia should be
treated as terrorists as they are attacking the very foundation of a nation. Now is the time for
the government to consider establishing at least an NCB to keep a regular tab on malpractices
in learning and education. 

Most private educational trusts were founded or backed by corrupt state politicians. 
So, the clamor for handing over NTA-conducted tests to the state should be seen through the lens of 
vested interests. To put it bluntly, with active help from 
powerful state politicians, the state-level education bosses are trying to destroy NTA's credibility 
and want control of NEET and other entrance tests to be devolved to the state again. There has been a 
clamor from TN, Karnataka, Telangana. Even the main opposition party, Congress to devolve the power of 
conducting eligibility tests to the state level. Once the control is ceded to the state, the 
education mafia would have a free pass to accommodate any candidate who approaches them with a 
heavy purse. At least one right thing is the breaches are getting detected. 

Let me wrap up this post with a few remarks about NEET 2024. 
- Court intervention on NEET 2024, like urgent matters, has yet to be up to expectation.
- The government must not outsource the investigation of the NEET 2024 fiasco entirely to the court's adjudication.
- The court may be involved in long-term legal and ethical issues related to the conduct of tests.
- It will be unfair to thousands of successful candidates if a retest is ordered.
- Retest is if large-scale leakage has occurred.
- The real challenge would be to localize the leakage-affected area where a retest can be ordered.
- The activities of coaching centers should be monitored regularly as a preventive measure. 
- Lifetime ban and heavy penalties should be imposed on politicians and operators involved in the leakage issue. 

Many of the points mentioned above would be difficult to implement as they may involve 
infringement of privacy issues. But desperate situations demand desperate measures.
