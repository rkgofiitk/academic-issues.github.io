# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of the day 19th of June, 2024 were academically hot as the long summer days the mercury hits
over 50 degree Celsius in northern parts of India. The first one is Nalanda Campus inaugurated by the
Primeminister at Ragir, Bihar. Kumar Gupta established Nalanda University in 14th century in plains of 
Bihar. It was hailed as the cetadel of great learning in the oriental world. Aryabhat invented concept
of zero at Nalanda University. The university excelled all branches of science and liberal arts and 
housed over 10k students from around the world. The Turkish origin muslim invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji 
destroyed the university and set its cherished library on fire. However the post is not about how 
it was destroyed, there are many accounts of the burning of Nalanda University in history books and
some excellent videos available in youtube. I wish to restrict myself to India's quest to reclaim
the venerable Nalanda legacy of the past.

The modern campus of Nalanda University was funded by cooperative efforts of 10 countries of east
Asia Summit (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand, Vietnam) along with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, 
Russia and the United States. The first VC was a person of the university was an associate professor 
of Lady Sriram College's Sociology Dept. However, the university's Chancellor and Chief Mentor
was Nobel laureate Amarty Sen who appeared to have been associated on an honorary basis for nine
years. During its 14 years existence the university did not even cause a localized whirlwind 
with assemblage and association of world's authors, thinkers and historians. Something that is a 
matter of concern. It is quite surprising why the government of the day, the Chancellor, the
Vice-Chancellor and all their men women did not think of establishing science and engineering depts
in the university. It is difficult to visualize an world-class university for liberal arts 
without a mathematics dept! Perhaps the mathematicians did not foresee the revival plan of 
Nalanda's glorious past would ever be realizable, or they were not even approached. I wonder 
what kind of purpose an exclusive university of liberal arts may serve. I am not for a moment 
denigrating studies of social sciences. However, institutions of social sciences are at best
small single unit universities with low enrollments. Spending INR 1800 crores for a campus of such 
a university appear pure extravangaza for a government which is struggling even to ensure equal
opportunities for medical science. The country do need good doctors and many of them. About 2.3
million students sit for NEET test. I have no doubt at least 0.1 million (<5%) of them could be 
trained to become doctors if not more. Except for a few institutions like ISI, CMI and IITs
teaching of mathematics in statistics in India is in absymal state. We could train at least 
0.1 million students to become better mathematicians. Human resources is very important for a
country to become a powerhouse of ideas and innovations. Unless government makes a solid 
investments in HR, it would remain in the never ending loop of traders and service renders.

Erstwhile Nalanda served and propelled some of the greatest cognitive discoveries. It had disciplines
like mathematics, astrophysics and medical sciences.
