# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of the day 19th of June, 2024 were academically hot as the long summer days the mercury hits
over 50 degree Celsius in northern parts of India. The first one is Nalanda Campus is inaugurated by the
Primeminister at Ragir, Bihar. Kumar Gupta established Nalanda University in 14th century in plains of 
Bihar. It was hailed as the cetadel of learning in the oriental world. Aryabhat invented concept of zero
at Nalanda University. The university has all branches of science and liberal arts and housed over 10k
students from around the world. The invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji of Turkish-Musilm origin destroyed the 
university and set its library on fire. However the post is not about how it was destroyed, but about
looking forward to be rightful owner of Nalanda venerable legacy of the past.

The modern Nalanda University was founded by cooperative efforts of 18 south asian nations. The first
VC was a person of non-descript administrator picked from Delhi University's History dept. The 
university's ambassador at large was Amarty Sen. However, during its 20 years existence the university
has not been able to make much of a localized whirlwind with assemblage and association of world's
authors, thinkers and historians. Something that is a matter of concern. It is quite surprising why
Amarty Sen and his men and women did not think of establishing science and engineering depts in the
university. May be they wanted an exclusive university of liberal arts. But, it beats me to assess
what was the great plan of original founders and patrons to visualize an university of
liberal arts without even mathematics! What kind of purpose such a university may serve? Erstwhile 
Nalanda served and propelled some of the greatest cognitive discoveries. It had mathematics, sciences
including astrophysics and medical sciences.
