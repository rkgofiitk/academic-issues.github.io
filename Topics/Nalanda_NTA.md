# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of the day 19th of June, 2024 were academically hot as the long summer days the mercury hits
over 50 degree Celsius in the northern parts of India. The first one is Nalanda Campus inaugurated by
the Primeminister at Rajgir, Bihar. Kumar Gupta established Nalanda University in 14th century
at Rajgir. It was hailed as the finest cetadel of learning in the oriental world. Aryabhat 
invented concept of zero at Nalanda University. The university excelled all branches of science and
liberal arts. Over 10k students from around the world studied at Nalanda. The university's scholars
served knowledge contributors of highest calibre and propelled some of the greatest cognitive
discoveries of the time. It had disciplines like mathematics, astrophysics and medical sciences. 
The Turkish origin muslim invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji destroyed the university and set its library on 
fire. However this post is not about how Nalanda was destroyed, there are many accounts of the burning 
of Nalanda University's library in history books and the massacre of its scholars and students.
Some excellent videos on the topic are available in youtube. I wish to restrict myself to India's
quest to reclaim the venerable legacy erstwhile Nalanda University.

The modern campus of Nalanda University was funded by cooperative efforts of ten countries of east
Asia Summit (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand, Vietnam) along with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, 
Russia and the United States. The first VC was a person of the university was an associate professor 
of Lady Sriram College's Sociology Dept. However, the university's Chancellor and Chief Mentor
was Nobel laureate Amarty Sen. Apparently, Prof Sen was associated with the university on an 
honorary basis for nine years. During its 14 years existence the university did not even cause 
a localized whirlwind with assemblage and association of world's famous authors, thinkers and
historians. This is something that is a matter of concern. It is quite surprising why the government
of the day, the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor with all their men and women did not think of
establishing science and engineering depts in the university. It is difficult to visualize an 
world-class university for liberal arts without a mathematics dept! Perhaps the mathematicians did 
not foresee Nalanda's glorious past would ever be realizable through as revival plan, or they were 
not even approached. I wonder what kind of purpose an exclusive university of liberal arts may serve
in today's world. I am not for a moment denigrating studies of social sciences. However, 
institutions of social sciences are at best small single unit universities with low enrollments. 
Therefore, splurging INR 1800 crores for a campus of such a university having only 400 odd students
appears to be pure extravangaza, especially, when a government struggling even to ensure equal
opportunities for medical sciences to its aspiring young citizens. 

The country do need good doctors and many of them. About 2.3 million students sit for NEET test. I 
have no doubt at least 0.1 million (<5%) of them could be trained to become doctors if not more. 
Except for a few institutions like ISI, CMI and IITs teaching of mathematics in statistics in India
is in absymal state. We could train at least 0.1 million students to become better mathematicians,
statisticians or data scientists. Human resources is very important for a country to become a
powerhouse of ideas and innovations. Unless government makes a solid investments in human resource
development, it would remain in the never ending loop of traders and service providers.

The second event is scrapping of UGC-NET test by the Education Ministry. NTA now faces serious 
existential threat as a credible national test agency. The NET questions papers were reportedly
available on the dark nets before the test. Education Mafiaso is creating havoc in India and giving
serious competitions to perhaps the likes of El Chapo or Pablo Esocbar. IMHO these mafia should be
treated as terrorist as they are attacking the very foundation of a nation. Now is the time for
the government to think about establishing at least an NCB for keeping a regular tab on malpractices
in learning and education. 

Most of the private educational trusts were either founded or backed by corrupt state politicians. 
So, the clamour for handing over NTA conducted test to state should be seen through the lens of 
vested interests. To put it bluntly the state level education bosses with active help from 
powerful state politicians are trying to destroy NTA's credibility and want control on NEET and
other entrance tests to be devolved to state again. There has been a clamour from TN, Karnatak, 
Telengana. Even the main opposition party Congress to devolve power of conducting eligibility test
to state level. Once the control is ceded to state the education mafia would have freepass for 
accommodating any candidate who approaches them with a heavy purse. At least one right thing
is the breaches are getting detected. 

Let me now wrap up this post with a few remarks about NEET 2024. 
- Court intervention on NEET 2024 like urgent matters has not been up to expectation.
- Government must not outsource investigation of NEET 2024 fiasco entirely to court's adjudication.
- Court can perhaps be involved in long term legal and ethical issues in the conduct of test.
- It will be unfair on thousands of successful candidates if a retest is ordered.
- Retest is an if large-scale leakage has occurred.
- The real challenge would be to localize the leakage affected area where retest can be ordered.
- The activities of coaching centers should be monitored on regular basis as a preventive measure. 
- Life time ban and heavy penalty should be imposed on politicians and operators involved in the leakage issue. 

I know many of the points mentioned above would be difficult to implement as they may involve 
infringement of privacy issues. But desparet situations demand desparet measures.
