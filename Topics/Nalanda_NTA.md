# Nalanda Inauguration & UGC-NET 

The events of the day 19th of June, 2024, were academically hot, as were the long summer days.  The 
first is the Nalanda Campus, inaugurated by the Prime Minister at Rajgir, Bihar. Kumar Gupta 
established Nalanda University in the 14th century. It was hailed as the finest citadel of learning 
in the oriental world. Aryabhat invented the concept of zero at Nalanda University which revolutionized
mathematics and the scientific studies. The Nalanda University excelled in all branches of science 
and liberal arts. Over 10k students from around the world studied at Nalanda. The university's scholars
served as knowledge reserviors of the highest caliber and propelled some of the most significant 
cognitive discoveries of the time. It had disciplines like mathematics, astrophysics, and medical 
sciences. The Turkish-origin Muslim invader Bakhtiyar Khiliji destroyed the university and set its 
famous library on fire. However, this post is not about how Nalanda was destroyed; there are many
accounts of the burning of Nalanda University's library in history books and the massacre of its
scholars and students. Some excellent videos on the topic are available on YouTube. I wish to 
restrict myself to India's quest to reclaim the venerable legacy of erstwhile Nalanda University.

The new Nalanda University and its ultra modern campus of in Rajgir was funded by cooperative 
efforts of ten countries in the east Asia Summit (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, 
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) along with Australia, China, India, Japan, 
New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States. The first VC was a person of 
the university who was an associate professor of Lady Sriram College's Sociology Dept. However, 
the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen held the post of university's first Chancellor and Chief Mentor
for nine long years from 2010-2019. Apparently, Prof Sen was associated with the university on an 
honorary basis. During its 14 years, the university did not cause a localized whirlwind with 
assemblage and association of the world's famous authors, economist, thinkers, and historians. 
It is something of a matter of concern. Surprisingly, the government of the day (headed by
another acclaimed economist Dr. Manmohan Singh), the Chancellor, and the Vice-Chancellor, with
all their wise men and women, did not think of establishing science and engineering depts in 
the university. IMHO, it is difficult to visualize a world-class university for liberal arts without
a mathematics dept! I belive one of the three or all of three may be correct:

- The mathematicians did not believe in Nalanda's glorious past, or
- Those who belived in Nalanda's past, thought it is unrealizable dream, or 
- The new university's policy framer did not think of importance of Mathematics.

I wonder what kind of purpose an exclusive liberal arts university may serve in today's world. I am not 
denigrating studies of social sciences. However, institutions of social sciences are, at best, small
single-unit universities with low enrollments. Therefore, splurging INR 1800 crores for a campus of 
such a university with only 400 odd students appears to be a pure extravaganza, especially when a
government is struggling even to ensure equal opportunities for medical sciences to its aspiring 
young citizens. 

The country needs good doctors, and many of them. About 2.3 million students sit for the NEET test. I 
think at least 0.1 million (<5%) of them could be trained to become doctors, if not more. 
Except for a few institutions like ISI, CMI, and IITs, teaching mathematics in statistics in India
is in abysmal state. We could train at least 0.1 million students to become better mathematicians,
statisticians, or data scientists. Human resources is critical for a country to become a
powerhouse of ideas and innovations. Unless the government invests in human resource
development, it will remain in the never-ending loop of traders and service providers.

The second event is the scrapping of the UGC-NET test by the Education Ministry. NTA now faces a severe 
existential threat as a credible national test agency. The NET question papers were 
available on the dark nets before the test. Even the joint CSIR-UGC-NET test scheduled for 25th June
now postponed  IMHO, the Education Mafiaso is creating havoc in India and 
putting severe competition to El Chapo or Pablo Escobar. IMHO, these mafia should be
treated as terrorists as they are attacking the very foundation of a nation. Now is the time for
the government to consider establishing at least an NCB to keep a regular tab on malpractices
in learning and education. 

Most private educational trusts were founded or backed by corrupt state-level politicians. 
So, the clamor for handing over NTA-conducted tests to the state should be seen through the lens of 
vested interests. To put it bluntly, with active help from powerful politicians, the education
bosses make consistent determined to destroy NTA's credibility and wrest control of entrance tests. 
The Tamilnadu government has consistently made it clear that NTA's NEET test is against the interest
of the candidates from the state. Karnataka, Telangana and other non-BJP ruled states have similar
view. Even the main opposition party, Congress supports the devolution of the power of 
conducting eligibility tests to the state level. However, if the idea of one test, ironically 
was propounded by the Manmohan Singh government. It if is rolled back and the control is ceded to the 
state, the education mafia will have a free pass to accommodate any candidate who approaches them
with a heavy purse. At least one right thing is the breaches are getting detected.As I said in my 
earlier blog NTA DG Mr Subodh K. Singh has been made a fall guy and sacked. However, the 
extent of the breach is yet to be explored fully. Now that CBI is handling the investigation, let us
hop the rot in NTA could be exposed to public eye. I wonder if the government wants public to believe
preventing question paper leakage is actually rocket science! The indicator is the appointment of 
high-power expert committee for NEET scam being chaired by ex-ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan. 

Let me wrap up this post with a few remarks about NEET 2024. 
- Court intervention on NEET 2024, like urgent matters, has yet to be up to expectation.
- The government must not outsource the investigation of the NEET 2024 fiasco entirely to the court's adjudication.
- The court may be involved in long-term legal and ethical issues related to the conduct of tests.
- It will be unfair to thousands of successful candidates if a retest is ordered.
- Retest is if large-scale leakage has occurred.
- The real challenge would be to localize the leakage-affected area where a retest can be ordered.
- The activities of coaching centers should be monitored regularly as a preventive measure. 
- Lifetime ban and heavy penalties should be imposed on politicians and operators involved in the leakage issue. 

Many of the points mentioned above would be difficult to implement as they may involve 
infringement of privacy issues. But desperate situations demand desperate measures.
