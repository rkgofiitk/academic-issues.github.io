# Anonymous Donor and its Effects in Education Sector

A few days back, [IIT Bombay received INR 160 corers from an anonymous donor](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/iit-bombay-gets-rs-160-crore-from-anonymous-donor/articleshow/103035390.cms?from=mdr).
It hartening to see that successful alumni from an Indian institution is giving back generously to their alma mater. The
donation is not new, IIT Bombay has received large donations from Kanwal Rekhi, Nandan Nilekani and others in the 
recent past. Other old IITs and a few renknowned educational institutes are receiving generous donations from their 
respective alumnis. Well known universities world over like Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, CMU, Yale,
etc regularly receive large donations. However, this particular anonymous donation to IIT Bombay is a momentus event for
an Indian institution. I wish it to be a trend setter for donation to educational institutes in the country. 

Before celebrating the event, let us understand why donations are key to survival, autonomy, and excellance of educational 
institutions. Let us restrict the discussion only to Indian context. The problem is more or less similar elsewhere.
The total outlay for education sector in the central budget is 1.12 lakh corers. It includes 65k corers for School Educations
and literacy programmes and 44k corers for the higher education. India has an enrollement over 4 corers in higher education 
(PIB sources) in 2020-21. The cost per student in professional education is 70k per year. I think in non-professional courses 
the cost per student per year will be between 30-40k per student. Therefore, there is huge gap between requirements and 
resources. Govt spending on freebies are now between 1.7-2.7% of state GSDP. However, for the states like Andhra Pradesh, MP, 
Punjab, West Bengal, the figures are 14.1%, 10.8%, 17.8%, and 9.7% of their revenue receipts respectively. The state spending
on education and healthcare are suffering due to freebies or doles. AIDMK party in Tamilnadu was the first to start freebie 
culture for electoral gains. Other parties were quick to follow the electoral success shown by AIDMK. The debate between
subsidies and allocation for social sector is a complex issue. Freebies like food ration, mid-day meals provide a safety
net for survival of a large section of society. However, it also breeds a sense of complacency among the populace. It has 
led to a situation where GSDP is suffering as there is no sense of urgency for people to work for a living. Karnatak's 
congress party announced freebies to the tune of 62k corers prior to election in the state without working out budgetry 
details. If the promised freebies are now implemented fully, it will plunge the state of Karnatak into bankcrupty. Punjab 
is alredy in serious trouble. The story in no different for other states too. 

Education is a subject in the concurrent list. A majority of universities and educational institutions across the country 
are administered and controlled by the states. About 80% of spending in education sector is borne by the states. 
Therefore, freebies and spending an education sector are closely linked to the management of a states fiscal deficit.The 
states simply cut back grants to educational institute to tide over the fiscal deficit. As a result, the universities can do 
very little beyond struggling to maintain teaching activities. Most state universities and professional colleges typically 
operate with a strength of 30% regular faculty. By and large teaching activities are carried out using guest and ad hoc
lecturers who are typically paid a fee of Rs 500-1000/- per lecture. Under paid teachers are understandably are under qualified.
They neither have knowledge nor abilities to teach. There is no fund for research, or running science labs. Unless 
universities receive big donations there is no way they can survive under this situation. I was reminded of the situation
in Srilanka. Sometime back I received a request for evaluation of a Ph. D. thesis from a Srilankan University. After I 
had submitted the report, the university asked me to fill a form for claiming examination fee. Luckily, I came to know that
the thesis submission fee, examination fee, mailing cost all were paid by the student. So, I did not send the form and wrote
a waiver letter. The Srilankan situation may have a different explanation. However, the root cause boils down to the scarcity
of resources. Bad politics have already destroyed the system of higher education to a point from where it can never turn around. 

Now let us examine the situation in centrally funded institutions. At least the teaching activities in these institutions 
are managed by regular faculty. Research grants are administered through various agencies like DST, CSIR, ISRO, ARB, MeITy. The 
govt bureaucrats control of these agencies. Though DST chief is a technocrat or scientist there is no structure like NSF
where scientists control, evaluate and disburse the grants. I had handled both CSIR and DST grants. The level of book-keeping
is not worth the time to go for those grants. I mainly worked on multi-nation collaborative grants where book-keeping is 
relative easy. The institute finance and accounting department enforces its own level of bureaucratic interference specially
on grants from govt agencies. 

Let us delve a bit deeper on research and innovation grants. Government of India declared several institute of eminences (IoE).
The budget allocation for IoE has increased by 25 per cent from last yearâ€™s revised estimates.  The stated aim of
establishing IoEs is to encourage faculty members of those institute to compete with the highest levels of global excellence 
in teaching and research. It is however interesting to note that funding for most research programmes has stayed the same or 
decreased. I fail to appreciate the level of thinking that goes into the strategy to boost up research and innovation.
We cannot maintain islands of exellence when the surrounding is full of mud and dirt. IoE need a set of lower level feeder 
institutes for human resources. So, there should be a propertionate increase in research innovation budgets for secondary
level institutions. Even then, central govt's efforts will not work without support from state govts. Unfortunately, state
govts have a different level of thinking. Education appears very low in their priorities for being in the power. 

 Let us examine the effectiveness of CSR funding. The government of India 
enacted CSR Act in 2013.
It became applicable only from 1st April 2014. Tata and Birla group of companies were funding education institutions much 
before independence. Birla group established engineering colleges among these BITS Pilani is perhaps the best private 
engineering college which features in top 1000 world ranking. IISc is the most well known institute among several institutes 
funded and established by Tata group. 

The companies with 

- Net worth of rupees five hundred crore or more; or
- Turnover of rupees one thousand crore or more; or
- Net profit of rupees five crore or more during the immediately preceding financial year
  
are required to constitute a Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board. I guess the number of such companies will be
close 6000. 
The CSR contribution is pegged at 2% of the profit. CSR is still evolving. Government is persuading 
companies for supporting strategic initiatives for national building including cleaner and sustainable environment through CSR
avenue.  Therefore, CSR funding is not restricted to funding initiatives for education sectors. Educational institutions receive
only a small amount of donation for  come from CSR funds. Many companies have established their own educational institutions to
plough back CSR funding through the trust held by their founders. The total CSR funding to educational sector is nearly 3k out 
of 26k corers in 2020-21. So, CSR contribution to higher education sector is under 2% of govt spending.  



Given the scenario of govt grants, alternative sources of funding is very important. CSR funding has not contributed much
in terms of reality. The Act needs further update to encourage companies to donate to institutes outside their control. 
In this context, the anonymous donation that IIT Bombay received becomes
an event to celebrate. Let us hope, successful alumnus from different institutes give such generation donations. Once
an institute becomes financially independent there are less chances of govt interference. Furthermore, pressure groups and
well meaning educationists should lobby for an independent higher education regulatory board having a constitutionally
sanctioned power. Then it would be possible to stop the politcal meddlings in affair of a university.
