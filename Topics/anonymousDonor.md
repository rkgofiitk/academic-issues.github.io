# Anonymous Donor

Recently, [IIT Bombay received INR 160 corers from an anonymous donor](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/iit-bombay-gets-rs-160-crore-from-anonymous-donor/articleshow/103035390.cms?from=mdr).
It hartening to see that successful alumni from an Indian institution is giving back so generously. IIT Bombay has received large
donations from Kanwal Rekhi, Nandan Nilekani and others in the past. Anonymous donor giving large donations is common in USA.
However, it is perhaps for the first time that an Indian institution has received a substantially large donation from an 
anonymous donor. 

The total outlay for education sector in India is about 1.12 lakh corers. It includes 65k corers to School Educations and 
literacy programmes. So, about 44k corers are allocated to higher education. The government of India enacted CSR Act in 2013.
It became applicable only from 1st April 2014. 
The companies with 

- Net worth of rupees five hundred crore or more; or
- Turnover of rupees one thousand crore or more; or
- Net profit of rupees five crore or more during the immediately preceding financial year
  
are required to constitute a Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board. I guess the number of such companies will be
close 6000. The CSR contribution is pegged at 2% of the profit. CSR funding not restricted to contribution for educational 
institutions. It is a evolving term for strategic initiatives for national building including cleaner and sustainable
environment. So, apart from government funding, a small amount of donation for educational institutions come from CSR funds. 
A number of companies have established their own educational institutions to plough back CSR funding through the trust held 
by their founders. The total CSR funding to educational sector is nearly 3k out of 26k corers in 2020-21. So, CSR contribution
to higher education sector would be below 2% of govt contribution.  

Tata sons and Birla Group were big contributors before independence. They established and sponsored a 
number of educational institutions.  during IIT Bombay plans to create a Green Energy and Sustainability Resarch (GESR) hub with the money. Government is turining increasingly
parsimonious with grants to educational institutions. It has curbed the institutions to stop creativity and wild research ideas
from being pursued by its faculty.
