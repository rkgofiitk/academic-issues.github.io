# Anonymous Donor

Recently, [IIT Bombay received INR 160 corers from an anonymous donor](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/iit-bombay-gets-rs-160-crore-from-anonymous-donor/articleshow/103035390.cms?from=mdr).
It hartening to see that successful alumni from an Indian institution is giving back so generously. IIT Bombay has received large
donations from Kanwal Rekhi and others in the past. Nandan Nilekani donated 315 corers only recently. But, I consider the
the contribution of 160 corers from an anonymous as a momentus event. It perhaps will be a trend setter, and I hope more such 
such donations will pour in from alumnus of other older IITs. Large donations to US universities is common phenomenon. 

Before elaborating further on the requirement of donations in upkeep and diversification of universities, let me spend a bit
of time its background. The total outlay for education sector in India is about 1.12 lakh corers. It includes 65k corers for
School Educations and literacy programmes. So, about 44k corers are allocated to higher education. The total enrollement in
higher education in India is about 4.41 corers (PIB sources) in 2020-21. Cost per student in professional education is
70k per year. I think in non-professional courses the cost per student per year will be around 30k per student.

        The budget allocation for India’s Institutions of Eminence has increased by 25 per cent from last year’s revised estimates.  This project aims to establish 10 institutions each in public and private sector which achieve the highest levels of global excellence in teaching and research.
    The research and innovation budget has increased over the years.  The 2023-24 allocation of GBP 21 million is an increase of 275 per cent from the actual amount spent in 2021-22.  It is however interesting to note that funding for most research programmes has stayed the same or decreased marginally, but funding for the new World Bank aided project called Multidisciplinary Education and Research Improvement in Technical Education (MERITE) has increased exponentially from around £900,000 to around £10 million. It will be implemented in about 350 public sector engineering institutions and affiliated technical universities.
    The national mission on teachers and teaching which provides an integrated platform for building synergies among all the existing initiatives and augment capacity at individual level and also enhance institutional infrastructure for pre service and in service teacher training gets an increase in the allocation as GBP 4.5 million, a rise of 80 per cent.
    The University Grants Commission, the higher education regulator for non-technical education has received an increased allocation of GBP 536 million. This has steadily risen in recent years.  The allocation for All India Council for Technical Education, the second regulator and responsible for technical education has had its allocation maintained at GBP 42 million for the last three years.
    Funding for autonomous institutions in higher education have increased by 89 per cent over the last year’s revised estimate.  The main increases are observed in grants to central universities, deemed universities which are promoted by the central government, Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, School of Planning and Architecture and grants to Councils/Institute of Excellence in Humanities and Social Sciences.

This is an important budget year for the national government before the country goes into national elections next year.  Viewed from this context, the national budget for 2023 contains something for all – it is a mix of welfare and infrastructure led growth priorities with focus on inclusion and indigenisation.

While the Indian government has promoted the 2023 national education budget as the country’s highest ever, government education spending as a percentage of GDP has stayed the same for the last three years. Total education expenditure as a percentage of all government expenditure has increased slightly but remains lower than the percentage share in 2019-20.  This is likely to be due to low contributions towards the education sector from states, affected by their poor fiscal health and lower devolution of taxes received from the centre.  State level allocations for 2023 are yet not available to assess any changes in this regard.

The education programme outlay and the priorities announced in the budget demonstrate the intention of the national government to build on the reforms it started rolling out in line with the National Education Policy 2020 and bring about improved synergy in interventions and efficiency in implementation for better learning outcomes.  By March 2022, the student enrolment in higher education has increased from 39 million to 41 million, and the number of higher education institutions (HEI) has increased  to 1,113 universities, 648 medical colleges and 23 Indian Institutes of Technology. 

Various reforms which are already underway include the national curriculum framework for the foundation stage in schools, the National Credit framework which opens avenue for further progression for students and allows them to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, establishment of research and development units (“cells”) in HEIs for promoting quality research and productivity through collaboration with industry and national/international agencies, internationalisation of higher education through new regulations on academic collaborations and inviting international branch campuses.

Reforms in the education sector are expected to continue to progress, with the additional renewed focus laid out by the government on reading skills for students, teacher development, research and development in niche areas through this budget.  The budget also provides further impetus for skills development to accelerate progress in meeting the objectives of the flagship Skill India initiative launched by this government in 2015.

The government of India enacted CSR Act in 2013.
It became applicable only from 1st April 2014. Tata and Birla group of companies were funding education institutions much 
before independence. Birla group established engineering colleges among these BITS Pilani is perhaps the best private 
engineering college which features in top 1000 world ranking. IISc is the most well known institute among several institutes 
funded and established by Tata group. 

The companies with 

- Net worth of rupees five hundred crore or more; or
- Turnover of rupees one thousand crore or more; or
- Net profit of rupees five crore or more during the immediately preceding financial year
  
are required to constitute a Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board. I guess the number of such companies will be
close 6000. 
The CSR contribution is pegged at 2% of the profit. CSR is still evolving. Government is persuading 
companies for supporting strategic initiatives for national building including cleaner and sustainable environment through CSR
avenue.  Therefore, CSR funding is not restricted to funding initiatives for education sectors. Educational institutions receive
only a small amount of donation for  come from CSR funds. Many companies have established their own educational institutions to
plough back CSR funding through the trust held by their founders. The total CSR funding to educational sector is nearly 3k out 
of 26k corers in 2020-21. So, CSR contribution to higher education sector is under 2% of govt spending.  


during IIT Bombay plans to create a Green Energy and Sustainability Resarch (GESR) hub with the money. Government is turining increasingly
parsimonious with grants to educational institutions. It has curbed the institutions to stop creativity and wild research ideas
from being pursued by its faculty.
