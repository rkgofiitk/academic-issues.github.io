# Anonymous Donor

Recently, [IIT Bombay received INR 160 corers from an anonymous donor](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/iit-bombay-gets-rs-160-crore-from-anonymous-donor/articleshow/103035390.cms?from=mdr).
It hartening to see that successful alumni from an Indian institute is giving back so generously. IIT Bombay has received large
donations from Kanwal Rekhi, Nandan Nilekani and others in the past. Anonymous donor giving large donations is common in USA.
However, it is perhaps the first time that an Indian institution has received such a large donation from an anonymous donor. IIT
Bombay plans to create a Green Energy and Sustainability Resarch (GESR) hub with the money. Government is turining increasingly
parsimonious with grants to educational institutions. It has curbed the institutions to stop creativity and wild research ideas
from being pursued by its faculty.
