# Generative AI Beyond Speculation

Gartner traces the 12 year journey of generative AI from 2010 to 2012. Understanding of natural language is the point from where
the journey started. By 2010, AI researcher discovered vast amount of text helped in better understanding natural language compared
to using grammatical rules or syntatic structure. AI researchers grappling with texts in natural language to comprehend meaning
of word used in different contexts in a sentence. Even groups of sentences could have contextual meanings. Grammatical rules
and lexicons could produce useless translations berift of contextual meaning.It made tranlslation ineffective. Mimicking human
