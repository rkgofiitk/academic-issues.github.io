# Cronyism in the Game of Research Publications

[Blog Index](../index.md)

I am a bit apprehensive about approaching this subject in a blog. I hope serious researchers do not take it as casting aspersions on their research. Many young 
people are engaged in intensive research in manufacturing, IT and computing, electronics, fabrications,  and space research. My intention is not to discourage 
them but to be aware of many influential researchers at elite academic institutions of the country.

Ranking institutions and the requirements for SCOPUS publications in academic promotions have become big spoilers. The ministry of education, Govt of India, 
conducts an annual exercise to rank educational institutes.  The university grants commission has introduced the CAS (Career Assessment System) for promotion to 
higher positions in teaching.  It forces university teaching faculties to try and get as many SCOPUS publications as possible by often resorting to unfair and 
unethical means. I am not naming those universities; people aware of the academic world can easily spot these out. 

I was once a chair of the technical committee of an international conference. We received at least 7-8 papers from a well-known university. One of the papers was 
about sharing of the USB file system. I was incredibly impressed with the quality of the work. The paper was very well-written. Suddenly, I remember having seen 
such a paper elsewhere. After a bit of search, I tracked the original article that received the best paper award at the USENIX conference.  The paper submitted to 
our conference was an exact copy of the USENIX paper. 

A few other papers were intelligent copy-paste from other published work.  Our team tracked about 42 instances of plagiarism in a total of 204 submissions. 
Incidentally, one group of Chinese researchers submitted about 10-14 script-generated papers, possibly to check the credibility of our conference.  The number of 
submissions in the next edition of the conference dropped to one-third. 

Having dealt with the malady of junk publications, let me focus on cronyism in academic research. I noticed that a few influential researchers who have been able 
to get some name in the international arena elevated them immediately to research managers. These people often coerce, induce, cajole to claim partial credits of 
the researches done entirely by others.  If denied, these influential researchers often become vindictive. I am not elaborating much on the issue, but I recommend 
that blog readers watch the movie PHD (Piled Higher and Deeper) to understand what I mean. Cronyism has extended its tentacles to even some of the prestigious 
IEEE journals.  We have come across people with 50-60 publications who could not correctly explain their research when questioned a little deeper and do not 
understand the fundamentals of the subject.
