## Shortage of Skilled Programmers 



Before focusing on shortage of skilled programmer, let me take the readers about 50 years back to understand where we were and
where we stand now. IBM 1620 was installed at IIT Kanpur in 1963. Vikram Sarabhai inaugurated TDC-12 computers in 1969. TDC-16 
computers were marketed by ECIL during 1980s. ECIL designed a special purpose simple assembly like language called ECOBOL for COBOL 
programmers. It was quite popular among COBOL programmers. By early 1990s it became clear to ECIL that TDC-16 computers have outlived 
their existence. However, ECIL's computer group did not have good R&D group to innovate and design new generation machines. It had a 
few excellent hardware experts who were only engaged in troubleshooting customer installations as the Service engineers were not up 
to mark. So, the real experts were forced to work on field.  Furthermore, ECIL's market strategist and board of directors were 
probably unable to realize the growth potentials of data analytics in commercial space. Or they simply failed to convince Department
of Electronics to invest in research and development. 

Interestingly, Indian supercomputing initiative began in late 1980s. NAL built the first indigeneous parallel computer called 
Flosolver MK-1 in 1986. Following it, different govt organizations like CDOT-CSIR, BARC-DRDO, and CDAC focused on building 
supercomputers. CDAC was established in August 1988. It announced PARAM series of supercomputers which could achieve peak speed of 
6.4GF. It could consist of 160 nodes and an MIMD type parallel computer. A group of experts led by an IISc Professor Swami Monohar
built first Indian tablet based on transputers in 1999. Aakash tablet was designed based on Prof Swami Monohar's initial efforts.
So, the policy planners in Govt were very much aware of the low talent pool in the country. But until late eighties they did not 
think of the dire situation and that the talent pool in India has bottomed out due to lack of opportunities. Most brilliant brains
found ready acceptance in the US and other western countries.  The govt of the day had extremely myopic vision of research
and development and relied more on importing technology.  

NASSCOM was established in 1988 with mission to support IT BPM industry in India. One of its main goals is to facilitate growth of 
intellectual capital and strengthen talent pool in the country.  It spent years in devising policies and architectural framework for
growth of talent pool in software development and computer science education. However, it either did not invest sufficiently or did
not address the implementation related issues. Micro detailings were left to bureaucrats of IT and HRD who messed up severly. The
flexibilities in the framework were exploited by unscruplous operators and the talent pool was contaminated with digitally illiterate
people. Workforce with no training or skill aspired to get cushy IT jobs. Only a few institutes like IITs and NIIs could meaningfully 
contribute to talent pool. It led to growth of another set of unscruplous operators who created "finishing schools" with head-hunting
companies with promises for placements. They charge huge sum of money assuring devOp jobs. Very few people in govt bureaucracy understand 
that the IT sector is requires a foundational knowledge base rather than just B. Tech or M. Tech degrees in CS or IT. Most software
companies like Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Mindtree, Tech Mahindra have their in-house training schools. In fact, Infosys training
center at Mysore is much bigger than a small sized University. It can accommodate roughly 10k trainees. I am not sure about the success
rate of the trainees, but I guess about 10-15% fail to qualify. It essentially means out of total recruitees Infosys throws out nearly
15%. However, Infosys claims a success rate of 99%. 

There is a recent controversy regarding Infosys banning their ex-employees from joining the competitors like IBM, Cognigent, TCS, etc.
I am not sure if such agreement could be enforceable by law of the land. However, the HR dept of the companies come up with such stupid
rules from time to time to exert their control over new recruits. One of the fundamental issues in attrition rate that the software 
industry is facing now could be due to clash of HR specialists and core technical specialists. It is ironic that the HR specialists
who do not contribute anything to the revenue earnings of a company are in position to control core specilists due to their proximity
to the administration and the management.  

The purpose of the above narrative is to build the background that led to shortage of skilled programmers. The shortage of skilled
programmers has cascading effects on software industries. Let me list out only a few:

1. Companies compete against one another to lure trained professionals. 
2. Professionals with more than one job offers bargain for better offers.
3. HR depts resort to unfair rules in blocking individuals who want to leave.
4. Ongoing projects of companies are delayed due to lack of in-house expertise.

An Economic Times report (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/indian-it-firms-step-up-hiring-of-non-engineers-to-bridge-talent-shortfall/articleshow/87189175.cms) 
says to bridge the talent gap Indian IT firms are hiring fresh non-engineering students. I believe it is a polite way of saying some 
engineering graduates do not possess adequate skill. They also require retraining. Programming is requires systematic application 
intuitions. Any graduates with a bit of training in maths from a good school could very easily fit into the job. Learning syntax of a 
programming language is quite easy. Availability of good IDEs have made systax largely irrelevant. 

Unfortunately, at most of the schools the training is poor. A root cause analysis will point to the fact that the
educators don't have the required skill to impart the training. A skilled person from an average school is mostly self-taught. 
Coursera, MIT OCW, NPTEL and other line resources could help a serious sluggers to self-train to become a DevOP specialist. 
Many head hunting firms also run finishing schools for upskilling engineering graduates. I am not sure if NASSCOM, AICTE, UGC, 
Ministry of Education and other regulatory bodies realize the problem of ill-trained Engineering graduates. We have do have Teacher 
Training Institutes. However, I seriously doubt whether if they really have any contributory role to upskill the educators. MEITY, AICTE
and other govt sponsoring agencies provide funds for FDPs. But most of these FDPs are not focused for skill development. FDPs are
available for a range of high end topics like ML, AI, Blockchain, Wireless Sensor Networks, IoTs, etc. But how many of the FDPs are
funded for training teachers in imparting coding? Furthermore, the FDPs are typically of short duration, anywhere from 3 days to 
2 weeks. Getting a certificate is more important for teachers than actual learning. Most teachers take FDPs as adding a line in
their CV. To an extent, I  believe as a nation we are a bunch of opportunists and have little feeling towards nation building. 
I have seen people littering waiting areas without thinking about inconveniences to fellow citizens.
