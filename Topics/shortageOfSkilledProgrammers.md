## Shortage of Skilled Programmers 




Before focusing on the shortage of skilled programmers, let me take the readers about 50 years back to understand where we were and where we stand now. 

The chronology of events could give the reader a fair idea of the technological status and the evolution of computer science education in India.  In 1963,  IIT Kanpur 
received IBM 1620. Six years later, in 1969, Vikram Sarabhai inaugurated TDC-12 computers. Then in 1971, IIT Kanpur rolled out its M. Tech program in CS.  ECIL designed a 
simple, assembly-like language called ECOBOL for COBOL programmers. It was pretty popular among COBOL programmers. By the early 1990s, it became clear to ECIL that TDC-16 
computers had outlived their existence.  ECIL’s computer group did not have a good R&D group to innovate and design a new generation of machines. It had a few excellent 
hardware experts. But unfortunately, they were stretched out in troubleshooting customer installations. ECIL's service engineers were young rookies.  As a result, the real 
experts were forced to work in the field. Furthermore, ECIL’s market strategists and board of directors were probably unable to realize the growth potential of data analytics in the commercial space. Or maybe they failed to convince the Department of Electronics to invest in research and development.

Interestingly, the Indian supercomputing initiative began in the late 1980s. NAL built the first indigenous parallel computer called Flosolver MK-1 in 1986. Following it, 
different govt organizations like CDOT-CSIR, BARC-DRDO, and CDAC focused on building supercomputers. CDAC was established in August 1988. It announced the PARAM series of 
supercomputers that could achieve a peak speed of 6.4GF. It could consist of 160 nodes and a MIMD-type parallel computer. A group of experts led by an IISc Professor Swami 
Monohar built the first Indian tablet based on transputers in 1999. Aakash tablet was designed based on Prof Swami Monohar’s initial efforts. So, the policy planners in 
Govt were very much aware of the low talent pool in the country. But until the late eighties, they did not think of the dire situation that the talent pool in India had 
bottomed out due to lack of opportunities. Most brilliant minds moved out of the country and found ready acceptance in the US and other western countries. The govt of 
the day had a highly myopic vision of research and development and relied more on importing technology.

NASSCOM was established in 1988 to support IT-BPM industry in India. One of its main goals is to facilitate the growth of intellectual capital and strengthen the talent 
pool in the country. It spent years devising policies and architectural frameworks to grow the talent pool in software development and computer science education. However, 
it either did not invest sufficiently or did not address the implementation-related issues. Micro detailings were left to the low level bureaucrats of IT and MHRD 
who messed up big. Unscruplous operators exploited the flexibilities in the framework, and the talent pool was contaminated with digitally illiterate people. Workforce 
with no training or skill aspired to get cushy IT jobs. Only a few institutes like IITs and NITs could meaningfully contribute to the talent pool. It led to the growth 
of another set of unscrupulous operators who created “finishing schools” with head-hunting companies with promises for placements. They charge a hepty sum of money 
assuring DevOps jobs.  Even on-line skill enhancement companies also have roaring business at the expense of poor untrained students. 
Very few people in govt bureaucracy understand that the IT sector requires a foundational knowledge base rather than just B. Tech or M. Tech 
degrees in CS or IT. 

Most software companies like Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Mindtree, Tech Mahindra have in-house training schools. Infosys training center at Mysore is much bigger than a mid-sized 
University. It can accommodate roughly 10k trainees. I am not sure about the success rate of the trainees, but I guess about 10-15% fail to qualify. It essentially means 
that Infosys throws out nearly 1500 of its new recruitees. Of course, Infosys claims a success rate of 99%. There is a recent controversy regarding Infosys banning their 
ex-employees from joining the competitors like IBM, Cognizant, TCS, Tech Mahindra, LT infotech. I am not sure if such an agreement could be enforceable by the law of 
the land. 

The HR depts of the companies come up with such stupid rules from time to time to exert their control over recruits. One of the fundamental issues
in the attrition rate that the software industry faces now could be due to the clash of HR specialists and core technical specialists. 
Ironically, the HR specialists contribute little to the revenue earnings of a company. But they are in a position to control core specialists due to their proximity to the 
administration and the management. The above narrative aims to build the background that led to the shortage of skilled programmers. The lack of skilled programmers has
cascading effects on software industries. Let me list out only a few:

- Companies compete against one another to lure trained professionals.
- Professionals with more than one job offer a bargain for better offers.
- HR depts resort to unfair rules in blocking individuals who want to leave.
- Ongoing projects of companies are delayed due to a lack of in-house expertise.

[An Economic Times report](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/indian-it-firms-step-up-hiring-of-non-engineers-to-bridge-talent-shortfall/articleshow/87189175.cms) 
says to bridge the talent gap Indian IT firms are hiring fresh non-engineering students. I believe it is a polite way of saying that some engineering 
graduates do not possess the adequate skill. They also require retraining. Programming requires systematic application intuitions. Any graduates with a bit of training in 
maths from a good school could very easily fit into the job. Learning the syntax of a programming language is relatively easy. The availability of good IDEs has made syntax 
largely irrelevant. Unfortunately, at most of the schools, the training is poor. A root cause analysis will point out that the educators don’t have the required skill to 
impart the training. A skilled person from an average school is primarily self-taught. Coursera, MIT OCW, NPTEL, and other line resources could help serious sluggers self-
train to become DevOps specialists. Many headhunting firms also run finishing schools for upskilling engineering graduates. I am not sure if NASSCOM, AICTE, UGC, Ministry 
of Education, and other regulatory bodies realize the problem of ill-trained Engineering graduates. We do have Teacher Training Institutes. However, I seriously doubt 
whether they have any contributory role in upskilling the educators. MEITY, AICTE, and other govt sponsoring agencies provide funds for FDPs. But most of these FDPs are not 
focused on skill development. FDPs are available for high-end topics like ML, AI, Blockchain, Wireless Sensor Networks, IoT, etc. But how many of the FDPs are funded for 
training teachers in imparting coding? Furthermore, the FDPs are typical of short duration, anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. Getting a certificate is more important for 
teachers than actual learning. Most teachers take FDPs as adding a line to their CV. To an extent, I believe that we are a bunch of opportunists and have little feeling toward nation-building as a nation.

On a different note, I feel the propensity to circumvent the law at every opportunity is ok if it benefits oneself. The commitment to a fellow citizen is low among 
Indians. People litter waiting areas in stations without thinking about the inconveniences it causes to fellow citizens. No one has respect for the time of others. People 
try to muscle their way into the waiting queues. People use derogatory, disrespectable and contemptuous words against others who cross their way. A short sampling of 
posts on Twitter, facebook, and other social media as well as contemporary TV debates will explain what I wanted to convey. Notably social media posts are not by
illiterrate people but by tech-savvy educated folks who can influence public opinion and perhaps impact govt's policies.
