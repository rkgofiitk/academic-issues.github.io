## Shortage of Skilled Programmers 



Before focusing on shortage of skilled programmer, let us look back in time about 50 years back to understand where we were and
where we stand now. Vikram Sarabhai inaugurated TDC-12 computers in 1969. TDC-16 computers were marketed by ECIL during 1980s.
However, by early 1990s it became clear to ECIL that TDC-16 computers have become obsolete. ECIL's computer group did not have an
R&D group to innovate and design new generation machines. It had a few excellent hardware experts who were only engaged in 
troubleshooting customer installations. Service engineers were not up to mark. So, the real experts were forced to work on field. 

Indian supercomputing initiative began in 1980s. NAL built the first indigeneous parallel computer called Flosolver-MK1 in 1986. 
Following it, different govt organizations like NAL, CDOT-CSIR, BARC-DRDO, and CDAC focused on building supercomputers. CDAC was 
established in August 1988. It announced PARAM series of supercomputers which could achieve peak speed of 6.4GF. It could consist 
of 160 nodes and an MIMD type parallel computer. So, the policy planners in Govt were very much aware of the low talent pool in the
country. But until late eighties they did not think of the dire situation and that talent pool has bottomed out. 

NASSCOM was established in 1988 with mission to support IT BPM industry in India. One of its main goals is to facilitate growth of 
intellectual capital and strengthen talent pool in the country.  However, while it spent hours in
devising policies and architectural framework, it did not invest sufficiently or was not earnest in addressing implementational
issues. The flexibilities
in the framework were exploited by unscruplous operators and the talent pool was contaminated severely. Workforce with no training or
skill aspired to get cush IT jobs. Only a few institutes like IITs and NIIs could meaningfully contribute to talent pool. It led
to another set of unscruplous operators to establish "finishing schools" with promises for placements. The basic problem is IT 
sector is requires a foundational knowledge base rather than just obtaining a degree. 


But the national supercomputing project was launched only in 2015. In a sense, the 
US sanctions helped India to develop indigeneous computer capabilities and propelled supercomputing activities. However, 
Indian scientific initiatives were severely impeded by bureacratic browbeating and machination of a section of application users at 
the govt depts like NCMRWF. Though it is difficult to actually identify pain-points, it did not help to fastrack some of the 
wonderful initiatives. Many influential and corrupt politicians lobbyed for imports with the active assistances of corporate middlemen. 
However, it was an eyeopener for me to come in direct and indirect contact with "a few good men" among scientific faternity who were
undone by a collection of influential rouges in bureaucracy and people close to political establisment. 

The purpose of the  narrative is to build the background that led to shortage of skilled programmers.

In a country of over billion of people, there is always a few good men who swim against the general tide and invest sweat and blood to 
correct the course of "traditions and practices" in the system. Unfortuanely, they seldom succeed and at times villianized. The
curious case of ISRO's Nambi Narayanan is an example. 


The art of programming and programming tools have undergone a sea of change from 1990s. Most laptops have quad core processors. 
Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services) make it possible to acquire clusters on the cloud and deploy programs on them. Bodo
(http://bodo.ai/) offers tools for automatic parallelization of Python data analytics programs. Furthermore, in collobration with
Xilinx (http:www.xilinx.com) Bodo brings simplicity of Python to large scale media processing. Using native Python coding it provides
a new approach to HPC style parallel programming. The idea ultimately leads to a scenario where the requirement is for disciplined
coder rather than higly skilled smart programmer. A bunch of intelligent people trained in classical programming skills and tools 
can become as productive as expert programmer. 


Any graduates from a good school could very easily fit into the job.
Unfortunately, at most of the schools the training is poor. A root cause analysis will point to the fact that the educators don't have the required skill
to impart the training. A skilled person from an average school is mostly self taught. What are the options left? An Economic Times report (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/indian-it-firms-step-up-hiring-of-non-engineers-to-bridge-talent-shortfall/articleshow/87189175.cms) 
says to bridge the talent gap Indian IT firms are hiring fresh non-engineering students. I believe it is a polite way of saying some engineering graduates 
do not possess adequate skill. They also require retraining. Many head hunting firms also run finishing schools for upskilling engineering
graduates. I am not sure if NASSCOM, AICTE, UGC, Ministry of Education and other regulatory bodies realize the problem of ill-trained Engineering graduates. 
We have do have Teacher Training Institutes. However, I seriously doubt whether if they really have any contributory role to upskill the educators.
