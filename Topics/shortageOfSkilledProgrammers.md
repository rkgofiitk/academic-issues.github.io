## Shortage of Skilled Programmers

India's first thermo-nuclear test code named Smiling Budha was conducted in 1974 on Buddha Jayanti day. The yield from the test remains 
wrapped in controversies. Many external experts believe it was a failure. The US conceded that test was inconsequential in quest for
acquiring building capabilities for weapon graded devices.  In 1998, India detonated 5 thermo nuclear devices under the project code
named Shakti. Two of these tests were recorded in seisemic monitors. The others were sub-kiloton devices which could not be recorded by
seisemic monitors. The tests were widely condemned by US, China, Canada and Pakistan. The US was acutely embarassed as it was 
continuously monitoring Indian activities in Pokharan test range but failed to detect any preparation for the test. It  reacted by 
imposing strict sanction against export of sensitive technology. Exporting high end super computers is one of these technology, because
it was believed TIFR's super computers were used for simulation in preparation for the tests. Around the same time IBM exited from India.
It created problems for experimental scientists who reled heavily on simulation.  

CDAC was established in August 1988. It created a flutter in technology landscape of India by announcing PARAM. At round the same time, three other govt 
research labs, NAL-Bangalore, BARC with DRDO Hyderabad and CSIR with C-DOT were building High Performance Parallel Computers.  

I finished my Ph. D. in 1985 with specialization in Design of Parallel Algorithms. I was lucky to get a few research papers published in reputed
professional journal. But, I did not know how could I contribute to HPC research in India. Only way things worked in job market in those days was to get 
hold of a copy of rozgar samachar (english version was employment news) or scan well known news papers like ToI/Statesman/Hindu/IE for 
advertisements regarding employments. I soon became disillusioned and wondered how people could manage to get jobs. 
I started trying my luck with bank probationary 
officers. I qualified the written test on a couple of instances. However, when the interview board came to know that I hold a Ph. D. degree they politely 
rejected me saying that I am over qualified and should seek a professor's position at some institutions. Finally, I got a job on first attempt as a lecturer
in one of highly regarded institution of national importance. 

As a professor of an institute of national importance, I became an expert overnight and attended couple of meetings of DST where I came to know about 
PARAM, Anupam, Anurag, Flosolvers. I was particularly impressed by NAL's one man show. However, bureaucrat scientists of India were not impressed. They 
wanted Cray machines. I believe, they were apprehensive for two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>They did not have faith on homegrown technology which ultimately relied on imported components, and</li>
  <li>They did not have any training on design of parallel algorithms or MPI</li>
  </ul> 
Naturally, all the efforts of Atmanirvar Bharat quickly transformed to US nirvar Bharat. On one during the discussion, I was challenged by one senior 
scientist belonging to an agency for taking responsibility of training of parallel programmers. I accepted his challenge and asked him to send 20 of his
programmers for an upskilling in parallel program. But he never sent any trainees to us. So, my participation to India's HPC-cum parallel computing ended
prematurely. 

The art of programming and programming tools have undergone a sea of change from 1990s. Most laptops have quad core processors. Amazon EKS (Elastic 
Kubernetes Services) make it possible to acquire clusters on the cloud and deploy programs on them. Bodo (http://bodo.ai/) offers tools for automatic 
parallelization of Python data analytics programs. Furthermore, in collobration with Xilinx (http:www.xilinx.com) Bodo brings simplicity of Python to 
large scale media processing. Using native Python coding it provides a new approach to HPC style parallel programming. The idea ultimately leads to a 
scenario where the requirement is for disciplined coder rather than higly skilled smart programmer. If a bunch of intelligent people trained in classical
programming skills and tools can become as productive as expensive programmer. Any graduates from a good school could very easily fit into the job.
Unfortunately, at most of the schools the training is poor. A root cause analysis will point to the fact that the educators don't have the required skill
to impart the training. A skilled person from an average school is mostly self taught. What are the options left? An Economic Times report (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/indian-it-firms-step-up-hiring-of-non-engineers-to-bridge-talent-shortfall/articleshow/87189175.cms) 
says to bridge the talent gap Indian IT firms are hiring fresh non-engineering students. I believe it is a polite way of saying some engineering graduates 
do not possess adequate skill. They also require retraining. Many head hunting firms also run finishing schools for upskilling engineering
graduates. I am not sure if NASSCOM, AICTE, UGC, Ministry of Education and other regulatory bodies realize the problem of ill-trained Engineering graduates. 
We have do have Teacher Training Institutes. However, I seriously doubt whether if they really have any contributory role to upskill the educators.
