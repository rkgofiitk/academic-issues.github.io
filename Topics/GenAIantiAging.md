## Generative AI and Anti-aging Pill: A Heady Concotion

Recent debates and op-eds about GenAI created worldwide enthusiasm. Students are excited that they don't have to invent solutions
to class assignments. All they may require is the skill to ask the right questions. Journalists and mass communication specialists are
already turning to GenAI for news stories. Doctors and healthcare specialists may increasingly rely on GenAI for a treatment regime for
a patient. Lawyers may see GenAI as a rescue for arguing and creating legal plaints when nothing works in courts for their clients.
Judges may try GenAI to draft their judgments. Of course, software specialists are early starters in leveraging GenAI tools.
As I understand, GenAI makes program development becomes lot easier with GenAI. A software engineer comments
that perhaps GenAI is a glamorous tool for browsing, commenting, and generating quality queries for 30%ile the work that data 
analytic engineers do these days. However, the tool is more potent than that. In summary, a hell lot of things can be 
solved through GenAI by asking well-articulated targeted questions. GenAI has made life comfortable for people with white-color 
jobs. I don't know how many blue-collar jobs can ever be accomplished by GenAI at the moment, except for understanding 
the principles behind the working of a tool or machine. Whether assembly or disassembly of machine tools can also be done with
the aid of GenAI. However, 3-D rapid prototyping and GenAI can combine to invent better tools and machines to perform such 
tasks. The conversational large language foundation model has turned AI into a common men's tool. I am curious to know the views of
[David Paranas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Parnas) on it. Yet M2M communication, IoT, 
rapid prototyping, and GenAI together may create a scenario where many things become redundant. 

Drug discovery and drug adaptations could be a significant beneficiary of GenAI research. In this context, a recent tweet by
[David Sinclair of Harvard Medical School](https://twitter.com/Medyanin50Tonu/status/1680949507331092483) is very relevant. 
David Sinclair tweeted about a publication on chemically induced reprogramming to reverse cellular aging. Their research
is on a cocktail of chemicals for affordable age reversal and rejuvenation of the human body. The cocktail is a combination of a 
few known age-reversal agents, including Valproic acid, Tranylcypromine, and Pramipexole. Since most of the chemicals are 
commonly used for seizures, depression, and Parkinson's disease, respectively, GenAI may give a reply in similar 
lines as David Sinclair's years of painstaking research have concluded. If we create a wrapper on GenAI to recast questions
to ask, a simple Simon can make a fantastic mouth-watering pie with assistance from GenAI. Five takeaways 
are as follows:

- Generative AI-assisted information dissemination
- Generative AI destroys jobs
- Use of Generative AI requires a big power budget
- Generative AI model hallucinates from time to time
- Generative AI is a tool for easy integration

Information dissemination can be particularly easy with GenAI. Fake content can be dished out most credibly. Social
networking sites are already getting inundated by such content, thanks to ChatGPT. On the other hand, marketing people could 
leverage GenAI to produce sleek content-rich reports, which will make their lives comfortable. However, it will destroy many 
jobs as manpower requirements may shrink to unseen levels. Business gurus will find themselves jobless. Generative AI-assisted 
automation has the potential to turn a mediocre human into an outstanding professional. Some experts say GenAI creates more 
jobs than it destroys. But upskilling humans for such surface touch poses an unresolved challenge. An estimate says 1/3rd of
jobs across domains may be destroyed. AI-based automated solutions are power-hungry. A rough estimate presented by one researcher 
says running ChatGPT costs $100k per day for electricity for all automation requirements of a typical enterprise. Budgeting for 
such a hefty electricity bill is prohibitive for small players. Furthermore, as more AI-based automation gets deployed, it
will contribute significantly to global warming and climate change. On the other hand, small and narrowly focused solution models
can be deployed easily on connected local machines. A hybrid model may soon emerge to address the cost issue. 
A big challenge is to overcome GenAI-assisted models hallucinating from time to time. It could be a near-fatal problem in many
applications, especially for mission-critical tasks such as space exploration, nuclear and missile research. 

Assuming that David Sinclair's research on the affordable eternal youth pill becomes successful, we will have a scenario where
politicians will never age and wield power to eternity. AI-engineered solutions can provide them to emulate a thousand
Adolf Hitlers with little effort. Wars will be won and lost in the cozy confines of bedrooms or lounges. The age-reversal pill may take a bit of time for being affordable, but politicians can commandeer the concoction before anyone else.
We already had the experience of Trump receiving a cocktail of medicines in a military facility under the supervision of
top gene therapy experts to recover quickly from Covid-19 and lead the Jan 6, 2020 insurrection. The scenario does not seem
to be a Nostradamus prediction anymore.
