## Generative AI and Anti-aging Pill: A Heady Concotion

Recent debates and opeds about GenAI created a world-wide enthusiasm. Students are excited that they don't have to invent solution
to class assignments. All they may require is a skill to ask right questions. Journalists and mass communication specialists are
already turning to GenAI for news stories. Doctors and healthcare specialists may increasingly rely GenAI for a treatment regime for
a patient. Lawyers may see GenAI as a rescue for arguing and creating plaints when nothing is working in courts for their clients.
Judges may try GenAI for drafting their judgements. Of course, software specialists are early starters in leveraging GenAI tools.
As I understand GenAI makes program development becomes lot easier with GenAI. A software engineer comments
that perhaps GenAI is a glamorous tool for browsing, commenting, and generating quality queries for 30%ile work that data 
analytic engineers do these days. However, the tool appears to be very potent than that. In summary, a hell lot of things can be 
solved through GenAI by asking well-articulated targeted questions. GenAI has made life comfortable for people with white-color 
jobs. I am not sure how much of blue-color jobs can ever be accomplished by GenAI at the moment, except for understanding 
the principles behind working of a tool or machine. Whether assembly or disassembly of mechine tools can also be done with
aid of GenAI. However, I guess, 3-D rapid prototyping and GenAI can combine to invent better tools and machines to perform such 
tasks. It is the conversational large language foundation model that has turned AI as a common men's tool. I am not sure how
much of it can be appreciated by [David Paranas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Parnas). Yet M2M communication, IoT, 
rapid prototyping, and GenAI together may create a scenario where many things become redundant. 

I perceive drug discovery and drug adaptations could be a major beneficiary of GenAI research. In this context, a recent tweet by
[David Sinclair of Harvard Medical School](https://twitter.com/Medyanin50Tonu/status/1680949507331092483) is very relevant. 
David Sinclair tweeted about a publication on chemically induced reprogramming of reversing cellular aging. Their research
is on a cocktail of chemicals for affordable age reversal and rejuvenation of human body. The cocktail is a combination of a 
few known age-reversal agents including Valproic acid, Tranylcypromine, and Pramipexole. Since most of the chemicals are 
commonly used for seizures, depression, and Parkinson's disease, respectively, GenAI may possibly give a reply in similar 
lines as David Sinclair's years of painstaking research has concluded. If we create a wrapper on GenAI to recast questions
to ask then perhaps a simple simon can create a fantastic mouth watering pie with assistance from GenAI. Five takeaways 
are as follows:

- Generative AI assisted information dissemination
- Generative AI destroys jobs
- Use of Generative AI requires a big power budget
- Generative AI model hallucinates from time to time
- Generative AI is tool for easy integration

Information dissemination will be particularly easy with GenAI. Fake content can be dished out in a credible manner. Social
networking site are already getting inundaunted by such content. On the other hand, marketing people could leverage GenAI to
produce sleek content rich reports, so, it will make their lives comfortable. However, it will destroy many jobs as manpower
requirement will shrink. Lot of business gurus will find themselves jobless. Generative AI assisted automation has potentials to 
turn a midocre human to an outstanding professional. So, some experts say GenAI creates more jobs then it destroys. But upskilling
human for such surface touch could be an unresolved issue until someone is sufficiently upskilled for newly created jobs. 
An estimate suggests 1/3rd of all jobs across domains may be destroyed. AI based automated solutions are power hungry. A rough
estimate presented by one researcher says running ChatGPT cost $100k perday for electricity. Budgeting for such a large 
electricity bill is prohibitive for small enterprises. Furthermore, as more and more AI based automation get deployed it
will contribute significantly to global warming and climate change. On the other hand, small and narrowly focused solution models
can be deployed easily on connected local machines. Eventually a hybrid model will emerge to address the cost issue. 
In some instances GenAI assisted models appear to hallucinate from time to time. It could be a near fatal problem in many 
applications, especially if applied to the domain of healthcare. 

Assuming that David Sinclair research on affordable eternal youth pill becomes successful, we will have a scenario where
same set of politicians will weild power to eternity. They can engineer AI-based solution to otherwise incapacitate opponents
and annihiliate them. Whether 

Let us delve a bit deeper on negatives to understand if 
GenAI is a precursor to a Frankenstein monster.
