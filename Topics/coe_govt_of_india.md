# Center of Excellence and Institution of Eminence

Government of India supports about 275 centers of excellence under various schemes 
across different educational institutions. UGC has established 943 Centers of 
Advance Studies (CAS), Departments of Research Supports (DRS) and Departments Special
Assistance (DSA). Out of 58 thousand institutions of higher education, 1168 
universities are listed as degree awarding institutions. Fifteen govt run institutions
and ten private run institutions are recognized as IoE. Two of the private IoEs
are green-field universities and yet to be established. Three government IoEs do not
figure in QS rankings. Out of remaining twelve, only three institutions are
ranked under 200 in QS-world rankings. Other nine are ranked in the range 271-1000.
Clearly, something is wrong.
