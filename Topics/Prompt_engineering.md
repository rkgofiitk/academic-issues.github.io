# Role of Prompt Engineering in Generative AI

Generative AI works by creating new text, images or videos by training from a massive amount of data. It 
learns patterns from those data and generates similar content. The principle
of extension is the key feature to generative AI. It cannot generate vacously. From the point of view of an 
user's interaction generative AI appear to be a dialogue based 
programming interface. Many experts view that this prompt-based interface is an extension to 
[test and debugging interface](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3673861) for the domain
of machine learning. There are two main concerns about the interface. 
- The prompt-based interface is rather loose and unoptimized
- It may, therefore, generate rather risky outputs

The question that AI experts need to ponder about is that 
- Whether they would risk on building critical application on top of generative AI model

The problem with prompting stems from the fact that it is not same as being able to communicate in natural 
language. When we communicate in natural language, the collaborators or the partners do understand inherent 
subtleness verbal conversation; and when they don't clarifications are sought. In human conversation, 
perceived intent in speaker's utterance plays and important role. It is extremely critical to understand
the intent. Double entendre is often used in political discourse. So, extension of true natural language
prompting could create confusion for users of generative AI tools. It may lead to similar near catastrophic
results as exhibited by heuritics driven soft computing methods even after lots of training.

Prompt-hacking could add or excerbate the problem obfuscating the intent in user's query.
