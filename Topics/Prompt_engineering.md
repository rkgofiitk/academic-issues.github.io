# Role of Prompt Engineering in Generative AI

Generative AI works by creating new text, images or videos by training from a massive amount of data. It learns patterns from those data and generates similar content. The principle
of extension is the key feature to generative AI. It cannot generate vacously. From the point of view of an user's interaction generative AI appear to be a dialogue based 
programming interface. Many experts view that this prompt-based interface is an extension to [test and debugging interface](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3673861) for the domain
of machine learning. There are two main concerns about the interface. 
- The prompt-based interface is rather loose and unoptimized
- It may, therefore, generate rather risky outputs

The question that AI experts need to ponder is that 
- Whether they would risk on building critical application on top of generative AI model

The problem with prompting stems from the fact that it is not same as being able to communicate in natural language. When we communicate in natural language, the collaborators or
partners do understand inherent subtleness verbal conversation.
