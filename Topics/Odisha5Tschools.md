# Status of 5T Transformations of Odisha's Govt Schools

[A recent news items in ToI](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhubaneswar/hc-to-monitor-availability-of-basic-amenities-in-schools/articleshow/100045353.cms) 
states that the Odisha High Court ordered its amicus curiae to monitor the progress of the 5T transformation pledged by the Odisha Govt. It is pathetic that the High Court
has to step in to watch a government's work in progress. According to the govt, 150 corers were allocated in Odisha State Budget in 2022-2023. Out of which 2.5 
corers were for one small district of Odisha for the upgrade and maintenance of primary and high schools. [One list accessible from Internet says there are
28 govt high schools in Boudh district](http://www.evidyalaya.org/listschool.php?d=boudh). The number of primary schools will be around 100 at most
(assuming a ratio of at most 1:4). The resource requirement for primary schools is very low. So most funds must have gone to high schools. I must add a
caveat here that I need more data to make a sweeping comment on Govt budget allocation for school upgrades. However, let me lead the reader to
a quick calculation of the extent of upgrade funding. Each high school may have received an average of 5-7 lacs for the upgrade. It is 
peanuts against the actual requirements. Of course, I know nothing about the current state of resources at any of the schools in Odisha except the 
Ravenshaw Collegiate School (where the Great Netaji Subhas Bose had his schooling). However, the average charge for a 3BHK interior is about 3-4 lacs.  
So, it is hilarious to advertise the upgrade as a 5T transformation as Govt of Odisha did. The advertisement budget may be more than the actual spending on
school upgrades. The likes of Goebbels always win. Ravenshaw Collegiate School is right across the street from the Odisha High Court. So,
the judges can walk into the school to inspect the state of affairs and resources that the school has. That school was in shambles for over the past 50 years or 
more. Shri Naveen Patnaik and his party have been in power since 2000. It means his govt is responsible for half the time the school was crumbling in last
50 years. The collegiate schools may have received a better infusion of annual funds than other govt schools. The hostel was abysmal; the classrooms needed to be 
in better shape. The roofs were leaking. The school has a large playground and a decent toilet at one point in time. Neither the playground 
nor the restrooms were maintained to the level of a decent school. I wrote a piece in 
[my blog earlier about the 5T transformation scheme of Odisha Govt](OdishaSchools.md). I just realized the reason behind it. Now it appears from PIL at Odisha 
High Court that the scheme is a quick and efficient way to embezzle 15-20% of the 
govt funds through the capacity building route. No fool-proof method could be devised to ensure every cent is spent for the purpose. However, the PIL indicates 
that the 5T scheme was planned with a plain profit motivation. The courts cannot monitor every damn thing. Civil society is powerless due to
multiple conflicting allegiances. Only a crusader can make a difference. Unfortunately, state machinery was in cahoot with the party in power. So, the
situation looks unrecoverable, and the only way out is to wait for an avatar to descend!!
