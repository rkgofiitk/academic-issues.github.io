# Status of 5T Transformations of Odisha's Govt Schools

[A recent news items in ToI](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhubaneswar/hc-to-monitor-availability-of-basic-amenities-in-schools/articleshow/100045353.cms) 
states that the Odisha High Court ordered its amicus curiae to monitor the progress of the 5T transformation pledged by the Odisha Govt. It is pathetic that 
citizens must approach the High Court to intervene to monitor a government's work in progress. According to the govt, 150 corers were allocated 
in Odisha State Budget in 2022-2023. Out of which, 2.5 corers were for one small district of Odisha for the upgrade and maintenance of primary and high schools. 
I found [one list accessible from the Internet says there are 28 govt high schools in the Boudh district](http://www.evidyalaya.org/listschool.php?d=boudh).
The number of primary schools will be around 100 at most, assuming a ratio of at most 1:4 between high schools and primary schools in a 
district. The resource requirement of a primary school is very low. I don't think govt would plan anything except a teacher and a small room for a 
primary school. Most of the funds would have gone to high schools. I must add a caveat here: I need more data to comment on the government 
budget allocation for school upgrades. However, let me lead the reader to a quick calculation of the extent of upgrade funding. Each high school may have
received an average sum not exceeding 5-7 lacs for the upgrade. It is peanuts against the actual requirements of a typical high school. Of course, I 
know very little about the current state of resources at any of the schools in Odisha except the Ravenshaw Collegiate School (where the Great Netaji Subhas Bose 
had his schooling). However, the average charge for a 3BHK interior is about 3-4 lacs. So, it is hilarious to advertise the upgrade as a 5T transformation as
Govt of Odisha does at every opportunity. The advertisement budget may be more than the actual spending on school upgrades. Unfortunately, the likes of 
Goebbels always win in India. Ravenshaw Collegiate School is right across the street from the Odisha High Court. So, the judges may walk into the school 
to inspect the state of affairs and resources that the school has. That school was in shambles for over the past 50 years or more. Shri Naveen Patnaik and 
his party BJD have been in power since 2000. Cuttack Municipal Corporation is also under BJD. It means his govt is responsible for half the time 
the school was crumbling in the last 50 years. The govt also snatched a few resources from the school. The Bungalow of the headmaster was in dangerous
unlivable condition for a long time. Finally, govt acquired it. The school had a few teacher quarters adjacent to district and session courts. 
I don't know if the quarters are still in liveable conditions or have been snatched by the govt for another purpose. Still, collegiate schools 
may have received a better infusion of annual funds than other govt schools. About five years back, when I visited last, the student's hostel was in
an abysmal state; the classrooms were crumbling so was the school furniture. The roofs were leaking. The school has a large playground and decent toilets at 
one point in time. Neither the playground nor the restrooms were maintained to the level of a decent district school. I wrote a piece in 
[my blog earlier about the 5T transformation scheme of Odisha Govt](OdishaSchools.md). Now I realize the reason behind the scheme. The PIL 
brought before the Odisha High Court shows that the scheme is a quick and efficient way to embezzle 15-20% of the govt funds through the capacity-building route.
Many, however, say the commission (euphemism for a bribe) has reached about 30%. I know that no fool-proof method could be devised to ensure 
every cent is spent for the purpose. However, the PIL indicates that the 5T scheme was planned with a plain profit motivation. The courts cannot monitor 
every damn thing that govt does or does not. Civil society used to exert pressure on the government on social issues like health care and education. 
Unfortunately, civil society is powerless, with the influencers having multiple conflicting allegiances. Only a crusader can make a difference. Unfortunately, 
state machinery was in cahoot with the party in power. So, the situation looks unrecoverable, and the only way out is to wait for an avatar to descend!!
