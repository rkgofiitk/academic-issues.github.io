# Status of 5T Transformations of Odisha's Govt Schools

[A recent news items in ToI](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhubaneswar/hc-to-monitor-availability-of-basic-amenities-in-schools/articleshow/100045353.cms) 
states that the Odisha High Court ordered appointed an amicus curiae to monitor the progress of the 5T transformation pledged by the Odisha Govt. It is 
pathetic that citizens must approach the High Court to intervene and monitor a government's work in progress. Odisha state budget for 2022-2023 provisioned
one hundred and fifty crores for the upgrade of govt run schools. Rupees 2.5 crores was allocated for the Boudh district in western Odisha under the scheme
for maintenance and upgrate of primary and high schools. There are [28 govt high schools in the Boudh district](http://www.evidyalaya.org/listschool.php?d=boudh).
Assuming a ratio of at most 1:4 between high schools and primary schools, the number of the latter category of schools in Boudh will be atmost 100. The resource 
requirement of a primary school is very low. I don't think govt would have planned anything except possibly a teacher and a small room for a primary school. 
It means most of the funds from 2.5 crores would have gone for upgrade of high schools. I must add a caveat here: I don't have enough data to comment on
the government budget allocation for school upgrades. Leaving 50lac rupees for primary schools, at most two crores would have been provisioned for twenty
eight high schools in the district. So, each high school may have received an average sum not exceeding eight lacs for the upgrade. It is peanuts against 
the actual requirements of a typical high school. Of course, I know very little about the current state of resources at any of the schools in Odisha 
except Ravenshaw Collegiate School (the Great Netaji Subhas Bose had his schooling in Ravenshaw Collegiate). The average charge for a 3BHK interior is 
about 3-4 lac rupees. So, it is hilarious to advertise the upgrade as a 5T transformation as Govt of Odisha does at every opportunity. The advertisement
budget may be more than the actual spending on school upgrades. Unfortunately, the likes of Goebbels always win in India.

Ravenshaw Collegiate School
is right across the street from the Odisha High Court. So, the judges may walk into the school to physically inspect the state of affairs and 
resources available. in that school. That school was in shambles for over the past 50 years or more. Shri Naveen Patnaik and his party BJD have been 
in power since 2000. Cuttack Municipal Corporation is also under BJD. It means his govt is responsible for half the time the school was crumbling 
in the last 50 years. The govt also did a lot of dis-service by snatching a few resources from the school. The Bungalow of the headmaster was in 
dangerous unlivable condition. Govt first acquired it saying the building would be
reneovated and brought back to liveable condition. However, progressively the area was occupied for other purpose. The school had a few teacher quarters
adjacent to district and session courts. I don't know if the quarters are still in liveable conditions and teachers or the head master still live there. 
Still, collegiate schools may have received a better infusion of annual funds than other govt schools. About 5 years back, I walked around the school. I could
see that the student's hostel was in an abysmal state; the classrooms were crumbling. The school has a large playground and decent toilets at 
one point in time. Neither the playground nor the restrooms were maintained to the level of a decent district school. 

Earlier, I wrote a
[blog about the 5T transformation scheme of Odisha Govt](OdishaSchools.md). I thought Odisha govt is really doing some good work in upgrading schools.
But, now I realize the real reason behind the scheme. The PIL brought before the Odisha High Court appears to suggest that the scheme is a scam. A potent 
conooction of politicians, administrative service, police service, and the lower judicery severely affects progress of Indian states. The higher judicery 
is the only recourse that the citizens may have. However, the legal system is antiquated and over burdened to react until it is too late. Sometime 
the constitution plays spoilsport. Transferring control of services to Delhi govt is an example. I am sure it will be plundered to whims and fancy of 
the party in power, as we witenessed recently. It appears every political party has glued together a well structured organized looting of state fund to
enrich their coeffers and keep a well-balanced reciprocation to be able to apply the concoction when needed. The 5T transformation scheme of Odisha govt 
appears to be a quick and efficient way to embezzle 15-20% of state funds through the capacity-building route. 
However, many would say that the commission (euphemism for a bribe) has reached about 30%. I know that no fool-proof method could be devised to ensure 
every cent is spent for the purpose. However, the PIL indicates that the 5T scheme was planned with a plain profit motivation. 

The courts cannot monitor 
every damn thing that govt does or does not. Civil society used to exert pressure on the government on social issues like health care and education. 
Unfortunately, civil society is powerless, with the influencers having multiple conflicting allegiances. Only a crusader can make a difference. Unfortunately, 
state machinery was in cahoot with the party in power. So, the situation looks unrecoverable, and the only way out is to wait for an avatar to descend!!
