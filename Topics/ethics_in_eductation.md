# Ethics in Education and Research

Cheating and plagiarism is menace that afflicts the education and research not only in India but world-wide. From time to time, reports appear in various 
channels in media and social network handles bemoaning the extent of its adverse impacts on the quality of education and research. It demotivates the educators
and researchers across the board. Even those who indulge in plagiarism and cheating for quick success are not immune from it. The honest people hard 
working people suffer from humiliations that those who are less endowed get early success. Many often get caught in the act of cheating and fail to
recover from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes much faster than ascent to fame. So, resorting to plagiarism is mostly a lose-lose
situation for the research and education. The short-cuts to get listed in hall fame often lands one to the hall of shame. 

The histroy of ancient India tells us a different story. Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, Kanad, Nagarjuna, Bodhayan, Bramhagupta, 
Varahamihira, Kautuliya, Patanjali had made Bharat famous. They could not have reached the pinnacle of
glory and success if fair amount of ancient literature did not exist at the time. India was known for its enlighitened thinkers and scholars until 700 AD who flourished
and enriched its knowledge centers at the ancient universities lile Takshilla, Vikramshilla, Nalanda. The spate of invasion by the marauders like Muhammed Bin Kassim, Ghengiz Khan, Taimur 
Lang,  Mahamud Gazni, Mohammad Shah Ghori, and the Moghuls ruined the country from 7th century to 13th century AD. Toramana Shahi Jauvla, the Hun
invaders was said to have destroyed Takshilla during 5th centuty BC. But many believe either Alexander or Mihirakula of Hun dinasty was behind 
destruction of Takshilla, because Kautilya (372-283 BC) studied in Takshilla and joined its faculty. The Hun Toramana's time was much before it. 
Baktiyar Khiliji the monstrous general of Mahammad Ghori killed the monks, destroyed monastary and destroyed Nalanda University, burnt down
its famous library in 1193 AD. The Turkish and Mongols invaders were only after India's wealth. Babur transported much of his loots from India to Samarkand.
They systematically continued plunder of India and never thought of building great institutions like Nalanda. The long reign of terror only made Indians to
abandon ethics and morality and adopted deceit, falsehood, and immoral means for survival under adverse situations. 
The revival of education system was brought about by the Britishers. The British colonizers were not driven by any altruism though they were far more tolerant than 
Mongol, Turkic and Moghul colonizers. The British colonizer trained people for the administration a large population and a vast country. Only about a
hundred to two hundred thousand Britishers ever lived and rule India. So, they needed aparatus to administer a vast country of 30-40 corers. Therefore, the current 
system of education in India has the old British legacy. The Britishers did not care about ethics, morality or law among native Indian
as long as their interests were served. 

This writeup is not about philosophical basis of human conduct, my concern is about ethics in educational institutions, teaching and research. 
However, it is pertinent to understand a bit about three loaded terms ethics, morality and law. These three terms express intertwined concepts. Morality is based
expected behavior of a person in the society and family. Morality is best described by the behavior a random person when he watches a drowning boy in 
a muddy pond. The society expects that the person should pull out the boy from the pond.  Suppose the person later narrating the event of 
drowning boy to his family or friends tells that he let the boy drown because his clothes would be dirty or many other people watched the event
and did not come to help, so he also did not come to rescue of the boy. The person will be considered as monster and unfit for the society 
because of his moral vacuousness. However, morality is not the ultimate thing. Consider the situation where a doctor at a hospital has only 
one anti-venom shot. An old person was brought to hospital just minutes before another younger person with the snake bites. Morality teaches
the doctor to administer the shot to older person and let the younger one die. However, the doctor learns that the older person has lived his
life and a family depends on younger one's earning. So,the doctor selects the younger person to receive the shot. The decision is clearly
rational and humane. So following strict moral obligations are not always acceptable. Law and legal acts are to enforce morality in the society.
Ethics comes on the top of both morality and law. Ethics When asked to define ethics we get different answers:

  - Ethics prompts me do correct things and prevents me from doing wrong things
  - Ethics is driven by my religious beliefs
  - Doing things ethically saves me from leggal troubles
  - Ethics consists of set of standards that the law requires me follow
  - I am ignorant of the term ethics

None of the answers seems to express ethics appropriately. We have to consider meaning of ethics from the scenarios discussed earlier. 
Ethics is derived from Greek work "ethos." Literally, it means way of living. Most appropriately,
it is a bunch of philosophies for human conduct in the society. Ethics enables us to examine rational 
justification of our moral judgements, it tells us what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust. There would not be any requirement for ethics 
if human being were not interacting with the nature or other humans.
It does not mean human existence is under bondage, rather it governs the freedom of human beings 
under a framework of interactions with the nature, community, country and global order. 
Without ethics system will be chaotic and anarchic. In a larger canvas we may view that the religious institutions like temples, churches, or political entities like countries, states, or  
organized communities like academic societies, or educationsal institutions all evolved with 
certain ethical basis.  

The terms ethics, morality and law have loose connectivity when seen in isolation. Most of us think that the utility of these phrases are restricted
only to preaching when it crosses human ambitions. The world being an unequal system, the yearning to get noticed has really no 
nominal bound. Law finally catches, but only when damages have already been done. In India it has reached a proportion not observed in the past. 
The phenomenon is witnessed when UGC and other institutions started adopting objective criteria for evaluating quality of research. 
In fact, teaching lost its relevance altogether. Publishing became the only criterion for career advancement. Though we have evaluation system for teaching
abilities, it is largely ineffective. The students who were unable to get decent grades decidedly give poor grades to teachers. Knowing background,
cultural and demographic composition of a class is important to get a good evaluation. The educators have responsibilities like a political 
leaders trying their luck to win an election. World is an unequal system though it offers opportunities to excel. Many good educators often flaunder in the quest 
to get good student evaluation. Recently, I watched <i>12th Fail</i>. It narrates the 
struggle of a person from Chambal (a geographical region called Bundelkhand in UP). There is a clip where teachers are dictating answers for a board exam. 
It reminded me about my own experience as a JEE representative. One of the college teachers of the center was curious enough to ask me if I came
from another planet where cheating in exam is frowned upon. Moral of the incident says the lack ethics and morality have no age boundary.

So far as ethics in research is concerned, there are umpteen known instances where many researchers  
- Often tried to use plagiarised material from well-known or obsecure sources in their papers
- Cooked intelligently camouflaged results as the result of their own experiments
- Added names of well respected researchers as one of the authors without any reference ever
- Script generated paper by crawling sources from the Internet
- Self-authored papers in the journals edited by them
  
A few enterprising authors could even get letter of accptance even before the journal issue has been announced. The retribution in most case only
limited to either retraction of the paper or redaction of parts of the paper. It is a question of balancing the gains against consequential loss when caught.
The temptation to fast track success is too much. The law against immoral, unethical behavior in research either non existent or has a very a high 
threshold as long as it is not pecuniary in nature. In fact, patent laws are separately identified in IIPR. 

Let us now take a look on indirect mechanisms for enforcing accountability in educational institutions. The third party supposedly independent ranking scheme 
like QS, THE, NIRF miss out critical input on ethics. I believe that ranking organizations themselves lack ethics. QS, THE, TIMES, and
NIRF ranking schemes try to achieve something impossible, i.e., comparing apples with oranges. They do seek academic perception inputs from experts,
but weigted ranking scheme can never be useful and bascially flawed. Recently, I came across another ranking scheme called urank (India Research Watchdog group).
It allows users to fiddle with relative weights but does not really explain the algorithm they are using. As a result it throws up interesting result such as
Saveetha Medical and Technical Science being ranked ahead of many older IIT even for engineering disciplines. 

It leads me to believe civic virtues like: 
- Loyality
- Fidelity
- Morality
- Self dignity
- Dignity in relation with others
- Respect for law

are important together with an expensive retribution mechanism. Reforms in watchdog (ombudsman based accountability system) mechanisms is extremely
important.
