# Ethics in Education and Research

Cheating and plagiarism are menaces that afflict education and research in India and worldwide. From time to time, reports appear in various 
channels in media and social network handles, lamenting the extent of its adverse impacts on the quality of education and research. It demotivates the educators
and researchers across the board. Even those who indulge in plagiarism and cheating for quick success are not immune from it. Honest, hard-working people suffer from the humiliation that those less endowed get early success. Many often get caught in the act of cheating and fail to
recover from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes much faster than their ascent to fame. So, resorting to plagiarism is mostly a lose-lose
the situation for the research and education. The short-cuts to be listed in the Hall of Fame frequently lead one to the Hall of Shame. 

The history of ancient India tells us a different story. Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, Kanad, Nagarjuna, Bodhayan, Bramhagupta, 
Varahamihira, Kautuliya, and Patanjali had made Bharat famous. They could not have reached the pinnacle of
glory and success if a fair amount of ancient literature did not exist then. India was known for its enlightened thinkers and scholars until 700 AD, who flourished
and enriched its knowledge centers at ancient universities like Takshilla, Vikramshilla, and Nalanda. The spate of invasions by the marauders like Muhammed Bin Kassim, Ghengiz Khan, Taimur 
Lang,  Mahamud Gazni, Mohammad Shah Ghori, and the Moghuls ruined the country from the 7th century to the 13th century AD. Toramana Shahi Jauvla, the Hun
invaders, was said to have destroyed Takshilla in the 5th century BC. But many believe either Alexander or Mihirakula of Hun dynasty was behind 
the destruction of Takshilla because Kautilya (372-283 BC) studied in Takshilla and joined its faculty. The Hun Toramana's time was much before it. 
Baktiyar Khiliji, the monstrous general of Muhammad Ghori, killed the monks, destroyed the monastery and Nalanda University, and burnt down
its famous library in 1193 AD. The Turkish and Mongol invaders were only after India's wealth. Babur transported much of his loot from India to Samarkand.
They systematically continued the plunder of India and never thought of building great institutions like Nalanda. The long reign of terror only made Indians to
abandon ethics and morality and adopt deceit, falsehood, and immoral means for survival under adverse situations. 
The Britishers brought about the revival of the education system. Any altruism did not drive the British colonizers, though they were far more tolerant than 
Mongol, Turkic, and Moghul colonizers. The British colonizer trained people for the administration, a large population, and a vast country. Only about a
hundred to two hundred thousand Britishers ever lived and ruled India. So, they needed apparatus to administer a vast country of 30-40 corers. Therefore, the current 
education system in India has an old British legacy. The Britishers did not care to enforce ethics, morality, or law among native Indians
as long as their interests were served. 

This write-up is not about the philosophical basis of human conduct; my concern is ethics in educational institutions, teaching, and research. 
However, it is pertinent to understand three loaded terms: ethics, morality, and law. These three terms express intertwined concepts. Morality is based
on the expected behavior of a person in society and family. Morality is best described by the behavior of a random person when he watches a drowning boy in 
a muddy pond. Society expects that the person should pull the boy out of the pond. Suppose the person later narrating the event of 
the drowning boy to his family or friends says that he let the boy drown because his clothes would be dirty or many other people watched the event
and did not come to help, so he also did not come to rescue the boy. The person will be deemed a monster and unfit for society 
because of his moral vacuousness. However, morality is not the ultimate thing. Consider the situation where a doctor at a hospital has only 
one anti-venom shot. An elderly person was brought to the hospital just minutes before another younger person with the snake bites. Morality teaches
the doctor to administer the shot to the older person and let the younger one die. However, the doctor learns that the older person has lived his
life, and a family depends on the younger one's earnings. So, the doctor selects the younger person to receive the shot. The decision is 
rational and humane. So, following strict moral obligations is only sometimes acceptable. Law and legal acts are to enforce morality in society.
Ethics comes on top of both morality and law. Ethics When asked to define ethics, we get different answers:

  - Ethics prompts me to do correct things and prevents me from doing wrong things
  - My religious beliefs drive ethics
  - Ethics saves me from legal troubles
  - Ethics consists of a set of standards that the law requires me to follow
  - I am ignorant of the term ethics

None of the answers express ethics appropriately. We have to consider the meaning of ethics from the scenarios discussed earlier. 
Ethics is from the Greek work "ethos." It means a way of living. Most appropriately,
it is a bunch of philosophies for human conduct in society. Ethics enables us to examine the rational 
justification of our moral judgments; it tells us what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust. There would not be any ethical requirements if human beings did not interact with nature or other humans.
It does not mean human existence is under bondage rather, it governs the freedom of human beings 
under a framework of interactions with nature, community, country, and global order. 
Without an ethics system, it would be chaotic and disorderly. On a larger canvas, we may view the religious institutions like temples, churches, or political entities like countries, states, or  
organized communities like academic societies or educational institutions all evolved with 
certain ethical basis.  

Ethics, morality, and law have loose connectivity when seen in isolation. Most of us think that the utility of these phrases is restricted
only to preaching when it crosses human ambitions. The world is unequal; the yearning to get noticed has no 
nominal bound. Law finally catches, but only when damages have already been done. In India, it has reached a proportion not observed in the past. 
The phenomenon was witnessed when UGC and other institutions started adopting objective criteria for evaluating the quality of research. 
Teaching lost its relevance altogether. Publishing became the only criterion for career advancement. Though we have an evaluation system for teaching
abilities, it is largely ineffective. The students who could not get decent grades decidedly give poor grades to teachers. Knowing the background,
cultural, and demographic composition of a class is important to get a good evaluation. The educators have responsibilities like a political leader trying their luck to win an election. The world is an unequal system, though it offers opportunities to excel. Many good educators often flounder in the quest 
to get good student evaluations. Recently, I watched <i>12th Fail</i>. It narrates a person's struggle from Chambal (a geographical region called Bundelkhand in UP). There is a clip where teachers are dictating answers for a board exam. 
It reminded me of my own experience as a JEE representative. One of the college teachers at the center was curious enough to ask me if I came
from another planet where cheating in exams is frowned upon. The moral of the incident says the lack of ethics and morality have no age boundary.

So far as ethics in research is concerned, there are umpteen known instances where many researchers  
- Often tried to use plagiarised material from well-known or obscure sources in their papers
- Cooked intelligently camouflaged results as the result of their experiments
- Added names of well-respected researchers as one of the authors without any reference ever
- Script-generated paper by crawling sources from the Internet
- Self-authored papers in the journals edited by them
  
A few enterprising authors could even get a letter of acceptance before the journal issue was announced. The retribution, in most cases only
limited to either retraction of the paper or redaction of parts of the paper. It is a question of balancing the gains against consequential loss when caught.
The temptation to fast-track success is too much. The law against immoral, unethical behavior in research is either nonexistent or has a very high 
threshold as long as it is not pecuniary. Patent laws are separately identified in IIPR. 

Let us now look at indirect mechanisms for enforcing accountability in educational institutions. Third-party supposedly independent ranking schemes 
like QS, THE, and NIRF miss out on critical ethical input. Ranking organizations themselves lack ethics. QS, THE, TIMES, and
NIRF ranking schemes try to achieve something impossible, i.e., comparing apples with oranges. They seek expert input on academic perception,
but weighted ranking schemes are flawed and can never be useful. Recently, I came across another ranking scheme called urank (India Research Watchdog group).
It allows users to fiddle with relative weights but needs to explain the algorithm they are using. As a result, it throws up exciting results such as
Saveetha Medical and Technical Science is ranked ahead of many older IITs, even for engineering disciplines. 

It leads me to believe in civic virtues like: 
- Loyalty
- Fidelity
- Morality
- Self-dignity
- Dignity in relation to others
- Respect for the law

Are important, together with an expensive retribution mechanism. Reforms in watchdog (ombudsman-based accountability system) mechanisms are extremely
important.
