# Ethics in Education and Research

Cheating and plagiarism are menaces that afflict education and research in India and worldwide. From time to time, reports appear in various 
channels in media and social network handles, lamenting the extent of its adverse impacts on the quality of education and research. It demotivates the educators
and researchers across the board. Honest, hard-working people suffer from the humiliation that those less endowed get early success. Those who indulge in plagiarism and cheating for quick success are not immune from it. Many often get caught in the act of cheating and fail to
recover from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes much faster than their ascent to fame. So, resorting to plagiarism is mostly a lose-lose
the situation for the research and education. The shortcuts to the Hall of Fame frequently lead one to the Hall of Shame. 

The history of ancient India tells us a different story. Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, Kanad, Nagarjuna, Bodhayan, Bramhagupta, 
Varahamihira, Kautuliya, and Patanjali had made Bharat famous. They could not have reached the pinnacle of
glory and success if a fair amount of ancient literature did not exist then. India was known for its enlightened thinkers and scholars until 700 AD, who flourished
and enriched its knowledge centers at ancient universities like Takshilla, Vikramshilla, and Nalanda. The spate of invasions by the marauders like Muhammed Bin Kassim, Ghengiz Khan, Taimur 
Lang,  Mahamud Gazni, Mohammad Shah Ghori, and the Moghuls ruined the country from the 7th century to the 13th century AD. Toramana Shahi Jauvla, the Hun
invaders, was said to have destroyed Takshilla in the 5th century BC. But many believe either Alexander or Mihirakula of the Hun dynasty was responsible for
the destruction of Takshilla because Kautilya (372-283 BC) studied in Takshilla and joined its faculty. The Hun Toramana's time was much before it. 
Baktiyar Khiliji, the monstrous general of Muhammad Ghori, killed the monks, destroyed the monastery, Nalanda University, and burnt down
its famous library in 1193 AD. The Turkish and Mongol invaders were only after India's wealth. Babur transported much of his loot from India to Samarkand.
They systematically continued the plunder of India and never once thought of building great institutions like Nalanda. The long reign of terror only made Indians adopt
deceit, falsehood, and immorality in preference to ethics for survival under adverse situations. 

The Britishers brought about the revival of the modern education system in India. However, the efforts of the British colonizers were not driven by altruism, though they were far more tolerant than 
Mongol, Turkic, and Moghul colonizers relied heavily on religious conversions to perpetuate their rule. 
The British colonizer trained people to administer a vast country with a large population. Only about one to two
hundred thousand Britishers ever lived and ruled India. So, they needed apparatus to administer a vast country of 30-40 corers. Therefore, the current 
education system in India has an old British legacy. The Britishers did not care to enforce ethics, morality, or law among native Indians
as long as educated Indians helped preserve British interests. 

This write-up is neither about the philosophical basis of human conduct nor the political underpinning behind ethics and morality in modern Indian society. 
My concern is ethics in educational institutions, teaching, and research. 
However, it is pertinent to understand three loaded terms: ethics, morality, and law. They express intertwined concepts. Morality is based
on the expected behavior of a person in society and family. 

Morality is best described by the behavior of a random person when he watches a drowning boy in 
a muddy pond. Society expects that the person should pull the boy out of the pond. Suppose the person later narrating the event of 
the drowning boy to his family or friends says that he let the boy drown because his clothes would be dirty or many other people watched the event
and did not come to help, so he also did not come to rescue the boy. The person will be deemed a monster and unfit for society 
because of his moral vacuousness. Yet, morality is not the ultimate thing. Consider the situation where a doctor at a hospital has only 
one anti-venom shot. An elderly person was brought to the hospital just minutes before another younger person with the snake bites. Morality teaches
the doctor to administer the shot to the older person and let the younger one die. The doctor surmises that the older person has lived his
life, and a family depends on the younger one's earnings. So, the doctor selects the younger person to receive the shot. The decision is 
rational and humane. Therefore, strict moral obligations are acceptable under certain environmental constraints. The role of law is to enforce morality in society.
Ethics sits on top of both morality and law. When asked to define ethics, we get different answers:

  - Ethics prompts me to do correct things and prevents me from doing wrong things
  - My religious beliefs drive ethics
  - Ethics saves me from legal troubles
  - Ethics consists of a set of standards that the law requires me to follow
  - I am ignorant of the term ethics

None of the answers expresses ethics appropriately. We have to consider the meaning of ethics from the scenarios discussed earlier. 
Ethics is from the Greek work "ethos." It means a way of living. Most appropriately,
it is a bunch of philosophies for human conduct in society. Ethics enables us to examine the rational 
justification of our moral judgments; it tells us what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust. There would not be any ethical requirements 
if human beings did not interact with nature or other humans. It does not mean human existence is under bondage. Rather, it governs the freedom 
of human beings under a framework of interactions with nature, community, country, and global order. 
Without an ethics system, it would be chaotic and
disorderly. On a larger canvas, we may view the religious institutions like temples, churches, or political entities like countries, states, or  
organized communities like academic societies or educational institutions all evolved with 
certain ethical basis.  

Ethics, morality, and law have loose connectivity when seen in isolation. Most of us think that the utility of these phrases is restricted
to preaching when it crosses human ambitions. The world is unequal; the yearning to get noticed has no 
nominal bound. Law finally catches, but only when damages have already been done. In India, it has reached a proportion not observed in the past. 
The phenomenon was witnessed when UGC, AICTE, and other regulating institutions started adopting objective criteria for evaluating the quality of research. 
Teaching lost its relevance altogether. Publishing became the only criterion for career advancement. Though we have an evaluation system for teaching
abilities, it is largely ineffective. The students who could not get decent grades decidedly give poor grades to teachers. Knowing a class's background,
cultural, and demographic composition is important to get a good evaluation. The educators have responsibilities like political leaders trying
their luck to win an election. The world is an unequal system, though it offers opportunities to excel. Many good educators often flounder in the quest 
to get good student evaluations. Recently, I watched a movie titled <i>12th Fail</i>. It narrates a person's struggle from Chambal (a geographical 
region called Bundelkhand in UP). There is a clip where teachers are dictating answers to the examinees in the board exam. 
It reminded me of my own experience as a JEE representative. One of the college teachers (an invigilator for the exam) at the center was curious enough 
to ask me if I came from another planet where cheating in exams never happens. I have to admit that our job was to minimize the incidences of cheating. 
The anecdote says that the lack of ethics and morality has no age boundary.

So far as ethics in research is concerned, there are umpteen known instances where many researchers  
- Often tried to use plagiarised material from well-known or obscure sources in their papers
- Cooked intelligently camouflaged results as those from their experiments
- Added names of well-respected researchers as one of the authors without any reference ever
- Script-generated paper by crawling sources from the Internet
- Self-authored papers in the journals edited by them
  
A few enterprising authors could even get a letter of acceptance before the journal issue was announced. The retribution, in most cases, is only
limited to either retraction of the paper or redaction of parts of the paper. It is a question of balancing the gains against consequential loss when caught.
The temptation to fast-track success is too much. The law against immoral, unethical behavior in research is either nonexistent or has a very high 
threshold as long as it is not an expensive pecuniary proposition. Patent laws are separately identified in IIPR because they protect corporate interests. 

Let us now look at indirect mechanisms for enforcing accountability in educational institutions. Ranking institutions is one such mechanism. 
Third-party supposedly independent ranking schemes like QS, THE, TIMES, and NIRF miss out on critical ethical input. Ranking organizations themselves lack ethics. QS, THE, TIMES, and
NIRF ranking schemes try to achieve something impossible, i.e., comparing apples with oranges. They seek expert input on academic perception, 
so we must revise weighted ranking schemes drastically if they can be taken seriously. Recently, I came across another ranking scheme called u-rank (India Research Watchdog group).
It allows users to fiddle with relative weights but does not explain the algorithm they are using. As a result, it throws up interesting results, such as
Saveetha Medical and Technical Science is ranked ahead of many older IITs, even for engineering disciplines. 

It leads me to believe in civic virtues like: 
- Loyalty
- Fidelity
- Morality
- Self-dignity
- Dignity in relation to others
- Respect for the law

are essential, together with an expensive retribution mechanism. Reforms in watchdog (ombudsman-based accountability system) mechanisms are extremely important. First of all we need a
careful selction process of people who may be ombudsman. The section process should be transparent where only persons with integrity are elligible for selection. Still there may be 
disputes. For example, parliament and assembly members are elected. There are many checks and balances to ensure free and fair election. Yet, we know that about 40% of these lawmakers
have criminal records. Law is inadequate and allows criminals to dance around the legal loopholes to enter  the temples of democracy.  Every system has it fair share of pros and cons.
For example, who would have thought about 6th January insurrection in US, yet it happened. In India emergency was imposed in 1975 and the constitution was suspended by Indira Gandhi. 
No one thought Indira Gandhi would be overthrown by an agitation by an unassuming septgenerian leader like Jayprakash Narayan, yet it happened.  The constitution was restored and 
democratic system resumed in the country. We cannot say that the constitution framer were idiots who did not foresee the problem. So, the point is if system is evolved with due 
dilligence then it is ok to assume that the system will work as expected with 99% confidence.


I wonder what could be the mechanism for checking the trend of  cheating by students. Many students who need not cheat cannot resist the temptation to cheat to improve their grades. Let us analyze the tendency of cheating among students in some detail. We can divide the  students into three groups:
- Top-tier students who maintain grade points of 8.5 and above on a scale of 10.
- Middle-tier students who maintain grade points between 7.5 to 8.5
- Bottom-tier students who maintain grade points between 6 to 7.5
  
Many students belonging to the middle tier take assignments casually. Some of them work in groups to solve a challenging assignment. They often run into problems with deadline management.
The top-tier students interact with the middle-tier but with caution. They try to extract ideas from the middle-tier students and work on them to meet the deadline. Bottom-tier students
try sincerely; often, they cannot complete, and many of them submit half-complete assignments or a few submit assignments copied from others. I am concerned with the middle-tier students.
Many of them are good at it and could achieve a lot working with a team. They have an intrinsic ethical way of learning. So, the system should develop a way to encourage them. However,
top-tier students may be dealt with care. Let me describe two anecdotes here.  Around the mid-nineties, the counseling service received an anonymous complaint that the student chosen to
 receive PGM had indulged in large-scale cheating in assignments. The gist of the complaint was that the student scored full marks in all class assignments without ever solving any of them.
The person would come and discuss the assignment with middle-tier students for days. After getting enough clues, that student would solve the assignment and quietly submit it. Although it is
not cheating in a strict sense,  it amounts to stealing IP. The next was a case of a student who would have easily scored 10 points and had to be expelled for a semester after a case of cheating
was detected. This student inserted answers in exam copies during the time of review. The act was caught by a professor who kept photocopies of exam papers before distributing them
for review. Most students copy programming assignments from Internet sites and their batch mates.
A  teacher with a zero-tolerance policy is overwhelmed by
the burden of detecting cheating in student submissions. ChatGPT and other generative AI tools have made cheating very easy. Policing is not part of a teacher's responsibility. With increased
enrollment, enforcing ethics among students has become impossible. Is there any solution to the problem? However, parents should allow students to pursue careers with enough freedom.
A student could choose two courses every semester that they find interesting. It would reduce the cheating load on both students and teachers. No number of laws and punishments can
enforce ethics; we need to create an environment for it to seep into the education system.
