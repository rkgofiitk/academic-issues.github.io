# Role of Ethics in Education and Research

Plagiarism is menace that afflicts the research community not only in India but world-wide. From time to time reports appear in various channels
in media and social network handles bemoaning the extent of its adverse impacts. It demotivates the entire research community. Even those who
indulge in plagiarism for quick success are not immune from it. The honest people hard working researchers suffer from humiliations that those
who are less endowed quickly reach the pinnacle of fame. The masqueraders often get caught in the act and fail to recover
from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes much faster than ascent to fame. So, resorting to plagiarism is a lose-lose situation
for the research community as a whole. Unfortunately, the  utility of phrases like as ethics, morality and probity appear to be restricted
to Dictionary of nice words when it crosses human ambitions. The world being an unequal system, the yearning to get noticed has no 
nominal bound. In India it has reached a proportion not observed in the past. The phenomenon is witnessed when UGC and other institutions started
adopting objective criteria for evaluating quality of research and teaching lost its relevance. Publishing became a game. I know many instances
where many researchers pushed self-authored papers in the journals edited by them. There are instances where author could extract letter of 
accptance even before the issue has been announce. It is time to dust out three words ethics, morality and law
from Dictionary and bring them in center-stage of our education system. 

Histroy of ancient India tells us a different story. Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, Kanad, Nagarjuna, Bodhayan, Bramhagupta, 
Varahamihira, Kautuliya, Patanjali had made Bharat famous. India was known for its enlighitened thinkers and scholars until 700 AD who flourished
and enriched its knowledge centers at ancient universities. The spate of invasion by the marauders like Muhammed Bin Kassim, Ghengiz Khan, Taimur 
Lang,  Mahamud Gazni, Mohammad Shah Ghori, and the Moghuls ruined the country from 7th century to 13th century AD. Toramana Shahi Jauvla, the Hun
invaders was said to have destroyed Takshilla during 5th centuty BC. But many believe either Alexander or Mihirakula of Hun dinasty was behind 
destruction of Takshilla, because Kautilya (372-283 BC) studied in Takshilla and joined its faculty. The Hun Toramana's time was much before it. 
Baktiyar Khiliji the monstrous general of Mahammad Ghori killed the monks, destroyed monastary and destroyed Nalanda University, burnt down
its famous library in 1193 AD. Turkeyaic and Mongols invaders were only after India's wealth. 
Even Babur transported much of his loots from India to Samarkand. They systematically continued plunder of India and never thought of building
great institutions like Nalanda. The great reign of terror only made Indians lose the affinity to ethics and morality when very existence 
is at stake. The revival of education system was brought about by Britishers. By and large British colonizers were far more tolerant than 
Mongol, Turkyaic and Moghul colonozers. British colonizer trained people for the administration a large population and a vast country. The current 
system of education in India has the old British legacy. However, Britishers did not care about ethics, morality or law among native Indian
as long as their interests were served. 

Now let us understand a bit about three loaded terms ethics, morality and law. These three terms express intertwined concepts. Morality is based
expect behavior of a person from society and family. Morality is best described by the behavior a random person when he watches a drowning boy in 
a muddy pond. The society expects that the person should pull out the boy from the pond.  Suppose the person later narrating the event of 
drowning boy to his family or friends tells that he let the boy drown because his clothes would be dirty or many other people watched the event
and did not come to help, so he also did not come to rescue of the boy. The person will be considered as monster and unfit for the society 
because of his moral vacuousness. However, morality is not the ultimate thing. Consider the situation where a doctor at a hospital has only 
one anti-venom shot. An old person was brought to hospital just minutes before another younger person with the snake bites. Morality teaches
the doctor to administer the shot to older person and let the younger one die. However, the doctor learns that the older person has lived his
life and a family depends on younger one's earning. So,the doctor selects the younger person to receive the shot. The decision is clearly
rational and humane. So following strict moral obligations are not always acceptable. Law and legal acts are to enforce morality in the society.
Ethics comes on the top of both morality and law. Ethics When asked to define ethics we get different answers:

<ul>
  <li>Ethics prompts me do correct things and prevents me from doing wrong things</li>
  <li>Ethics is driven by my religious beliefs</li>
  <li>Doing things ethically saves me from leggal troubles</li>
  <li>Ethics consists of set of standards that law requires me follow</li>
  <li>I am ignorant of the term ethics</li>
</ul>
None of the answers seems to express ethics appropriately. 
and friends expect from had little to do with plagiarism short span of time has hightened considerable becausef intense competitions. The short-cuts to get listed in hall fame often lands one
to the hall of shame.
