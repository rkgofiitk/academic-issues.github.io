# Pursuing Ph. D. at IITs

The purpose of this blog is to dispel some of the disinformation being circulated on a few social network sites. Quora is one of these.
Quora is a site where people ask questions, and others write answers. Sometimes both the questions the answers are targeted to rundown an organization
or an enterprise with a vengeance. It becomes apparent from the response that a balanced view is missing, and the attempt is well-orchestrated 
to target a well-established organization with a bias. There are so-called "influencers" who pick it up threads according to their agenda, and the story 
gets retold exponentially, leading to unrepairable damage. In [one of the blogs, I did write about certain undesirable practices that
many decorated scientists indulge in](../PhDstudents.md). However, that is not a generalization of the fact that some people try to propagate 
Ph. Ds at IITs. So, this blog is an attempt to straighten out facts. 

An understandably peeved responder writes that one should never pursue Ph. Ds at IIT. He reasons that professors in older IITs had terrible 
experiences. Well, he needed to name the specific IIT and the discipline. It would save some poor souls of at least a few freshmen. It
is well-known that the older IITs consist of IITK, IITD, IITM, IITB, IIT-KGP, and IITG. I have first-hand experience as a student and faculty 
member, at least in three of these older IITs. So, I know the system like the palm of my hand. I will restrict my blog by focusing on the f
ollowing points.

- Quality of students who opt for Ph. Ds at IITs
- Research grants for Ph. Ds at IITs 
- State of infrastructure at IITs
- Quality of professors at IITs
- Competition among professors at IITs to get students
- Opportunities for publications for research originating from India

Top undergraduate students in engineering get good placements and will be too reluctant to go for Ph. Ds unless they are specifically inclined. 
Any older IIT's placement record will be as high as 80%, if not more. Many undergraduate students work in freelance mode and try their 
hands at startups. Of course, that number will be small. So, let us say about 20% of undergraduates in engineering will be interested in
Ph. Ds. However, most of them try universities abroad. Ph. D. is a commitment for 4-5 years. Many will hang out for a year or so before deciding to join 
for Ph. Ds. I estimate that about 2% (in C.S.) of undergraduates will ever go for Ph. D.s at IITs. So, 
the input to Ph. Ds at IITs is from colleges outside the IIT system, and mainly in science or humanities. Our university
system is messed up completely. 95-97 % of the private institutions operate with very poor quality faculty, and govt (its regulatory
agencies, like AICTE or U.G.C.) don't care. Most good students will sit for GRE and opt for admission outside India. Hence, the quality
of students who come for Ph. Ds at IITs is not great. Sometimes the background is a problem. I am not passing judgment here. My conclusion
is based on the facts that it seems statistically plausible, with the caveat that I don't have numbers to back it.

About the second point, all institutions in India depend on grants from Govt agencies. Very few private enterprise help with C.S.R. funds. C.S.R. came
under the Companies Act only in 2013. However, most enterprises plough their C.S.R. funds into captive educational startups.  About 80% of govt
grants to IITs are for salaries. Only 20% of the grant is utilized for recurring expenses and capex funding. The recurring expenses
include maintenance such as I.W.D., electricity, A.M.Cs, etc. I guess it won't be more than 150cr per older IIT. The major flow of funds in research
or infrastructure upgrade comes under the HEFA loans. If someone knows about it can understand the implication of a loan versus a grant. In simple 
terms, it means most successful researchers in IITs depend on extramural research grants unless they are doing pen-paper kind of stuff
as mathematicians do!

Let us elaborate on the quality of professors at IITs. Getting quality faculty is always a big problem. However, Delhi, Bombay, and Madras never
had a problem attracting the best people. Kanpur, Kharagpur, and Guwahati had difficulties due to their locations. Even with locational
disadvantages, Kanpur and Kharagpur did well. Kanpur's first director PK Kelkar had a vision and made a few tweaks to rules which attracted
excellent faculty. Now autonomy of IITs is a myth; such tweaking of rules is impossible, and the successive govts spiked the selection process 
to get unscrupulous undeserving people with political connections 
to become directors. I explained the [selection process of the directors in an earlier blog](../universityChiefExecutive.md). Even with the useless 
non-leader, the intrinsic strength of the IITs was a safeguard. It is no more the case today. IIT senates have lost their strengths. 
Perhaps many things may not be ok with the selection process of faculty members. Perhaps good teachers are not encouraged anymore. 
Publications used to be a criterion earlier too, but not overly emphasized. Awards were encouraged, but not to the extent it is now. I know the 
S.S.B. awardees now aspire to become administrative heads or influencers. However, awards never make a soul good unless the person is genetically 
good. It brings a bad name to the whole institution with bad publicity and a fair share of legal troubles as many IITs have now. 
I agree that some faculty members run after awards and publications and indulge in internecine politics. Their students suffer due to it. Yet, one 
can easily spot them. If students fall prey to their charm and fame,
they do suffer. Many such faculty members even use their existing students as potential recruiters for freshmen. However, talking outside the clique, one 
may find bits of truth and conclude. Once an unscrupulous faculty member traps students, things can go terribly for them. However, I have also seen the 
other side of the story. Many students want to work under such faculty members considering the placement opportunities. So, they should not complain 
afterward. About 70-80 % of faculty members at IITs are good. Many of them are well respected even outside. 

There is a competition among faculty members to get research students. Publication record is one of the main criteria for promotion.
The requirement for good publications could be high or low depending on the dept. In experimental research, the research students are key to publication.
The participation of a faculty member in experimental research can be slightly better than that of a research manager. As I said, the
research grant is vital to any experiment-oriented research. So, lab setup and sourcing chemical reagents, equipment, and associated devices require
an external grant. The institute does not have any echo system to support a faculty member. So, apart from intellectual contribution, a
faculty member is supposed to accomplish everything within the first three years of their tenure at IITs. If the dept head is good or works in the 
same area, the faculty member may get a sympathetic vibe by agreeing to share credits. Nothing comes without a price. So, starting a career as 
a young faculty member at I.I.T. is no better or worse than anywhere in the world. Matching fresh research students to a faculty member's interest could 
trigger a competition. The matching process could be open or based on the criterion of equitable distribution. The competition is more intense in the
depts where the matching process is open, and poaching happens. However, equitable distribution is also fraught with
problems where students may have to join a least preferred professor and get demotivated. I have no straightforward solution to it. 

Let me deal a bit with research agenda. For example, in Computer Science, the agenda is set by big companies like Google and Microsoft. 
All undergraduate students want to work in AI/ML and Data Science. I have discussed it in an [earlier blog](../AI-ML-DataScience.md). 
A CS undergraduate from schools outside the IIT. system does not even have a good programming background but wants to work in AI/ML or Data 
Sciences. I learned from a young faculty member at one of the older.
IITs that getting a student who would work in the faculty member's area of interest is impossible. So, all the faculty members now work in AI/ML and
Data Sciences. It kills quality research. Only B-grade research gets reported. I don't know who to blame for it. Beyond C.S.E., research in
sciences at IITs is no better. I remember traveling in the company of a well-known professor in chemistry who
bored me all the way, and 1/6 of the whole day (4 hours) on politics denied him an S.S.B. award. So, I agree with the description circulating about a typical Science faculty member at older IITs. However, my experience with collaborative research with scientists in U.S. universities, 
Europe and Oceania tell me the problem is not typical for India or IITs. Sometime back in an earlier blog, I referred to a movie called 
P.H.D. (Pile Higher and Deeper). It sums up the life of a typical research student in an American University. So, to say that the U.S. universities are
better is a myth. No one looks at the root cause; if you decide to pursue a Ph. D at IITs, you have chosen to do so. Cribbing about it only
reflects your frustration. Any system has its fair share of good and bad. Percentage-wise, there are also as many good souls at older I.I.Ts as at U.S.
universities. Finding a good supervisor is a mature well-reasoned choice rather than swimming along with a bandwagon. The blame squarely lies on the
concerned student. It is like the wretched politicians we vote for. People deserve the leader they vote for.
