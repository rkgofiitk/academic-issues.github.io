# Pursuing Ph. D. at IITs

The purpose of this blog is to dispell some of the disinformation that is being circulated in a few social network sites. Quora is one of these.
Quora is a site where people ask questions and others write answers. Sometime the answers are kind of targeted in a way to rundown an organization
or an enterprise with a vengence. It is apparent from the answer that a balanced view is missing and the attempt is well orchestrated attempts
to target an well-established organization with a bias. There are so called "influencers" who pick it up threads according to their own agenda
and story gets retold exponentially leading to unrepairable damage. In one of the blogs, I did write about certain undesirable practices that
many decorated scientists indulge in. However, that is not a generalization of the fact that some people try to propagate about Ph. Ds at IITs.
So, this blog is an attempt to straighten out facts. 

One responder write never ever think of pursuing Ph. Ds at IIT. He reasons out that professors in older IITs he had a terrible experience. Well,
he did not quite name the specific IIT. But the set of older IITs consists of IITK, IITD, IITM, IITB, IIT-KGP, IITG. I have first hand experience
at least in three of these older IITs, as a student and as a faculty. So, I know the system like plam of my hand. I will restrict my blog by
focusing on the following points.

- Quality of students who opt of Ph. Ds at IITs
- Research grants for Ph. Ds at IITs 
- State of infrastructure at IITs
- Quality of professors at IITs
- Competition among professor to at IITs to get students
- Opportunities for publications for research orginating from India

Top undergraduate students in engineering who get placements and will be very reluctant to go for Ph. Ds unless they are specifically inclined. 
I believe at older IITs placement record will be close to 80% if not more. Many undergraduate students work in freelance mode and try their 
hands in startups. Of course that number will be pretty small. So, let us say about 20% of undergraduates in engineering will be interested for
Ph. Ds. However, most of them try universtities abroad. My estimate is about 2% (in CS) undergraducates will ever go for Ph. Ds at IIT. So, 
the input to Ph. Ds at IIT is from colleges outside IIT system and mainly in science or humanities. Let us understand that our university
system is messed up completely. I believe 95-97% of the private institutions operate only with very poor quality faculty and govt (its regulatory
agencies like AICTE or UGC) does n't care. Most of the good students will sit for GRE and will opt for admission outside India. Hence, the quality
of students who come for Ph. Ds at IIT is not any great. Sometimes background is a problem. I am not passing a judgement here. My conclusion
is based on the fact who seem statistically plausible with a caveat that I don't have numbers to back it.

About second point, all institutions in India depend on grants from Govt agenecies. Very few private enterprise help with CSR fund. However, 
most enterprise plough their CSR funds to captive educational setups or startups. CSR came under companies act only in 2013. About 80% of govt
grants to IITs is for salaries. Only 20% of the grant is utilised for IIT  in recurring expenses and capex kind of funding. Recurring expense
include maintenance such as IWD, electricity, AMCs, etc. I guess it won't be more than 100cr per older IITs. The major flow of fund in research
or infrastructure upgrade comes under HEFA loan. If someone knows about it can understand the implication of a loan versus a grant. In simple 
terms it means most successful researchers in IITs depend on project grants unless they are doing pen-paper kind of stuff as mathematicians do!

Let us elaborate on the quality of professors at IITs. Getting quality faculty is always a big problem. However, Delhi, Bombay and Madras never
had problem in attracting best people. Kanpur, Kharagpur and Guwahati had problems and continue to have problem due to locations. Even with locational
disadvantage Kanpur and Kharagpur did well. Kanpur's first director PK Kelkar had a vision and did a few tweaking of rules to attract faculty. 
Now such tweaking of rules is not possible and the successive govt spiked the selection process to get unscrupulous undeserving people to 
become directors. I explained about the selection process of the directors in an earlier blog. Even with the useless non-leader the intrinsic
strength of the IITs was a safeguard. This no more is the case today. IIT senates have lost their strengths. So, something is definitely wrong
in selection process. Good teachers were not encouraged anymore. Publications used to be a criteria for always, but not overly emphasized. Awards
were encouraged but not to the extent it is now. I know the SSB awardees now aspire to become administrative heads or influencers. However,
awards never make a soul good unless the genetically the person is a good human being. It brings bad name to the whole institution with bad 
publicity and a fair share of legal troubles. So, I do agree to the point some faculty members run after awards, publications, and indulge in
internecine politics. Their students suffer due to it. Yet, I believe one can easily spot them. If students fall prey to their charm and fame
they do suffer. Once students were trapped to such a faculty member then things can go really bad for them. However, I have also seen other side
of the story. Many students want to work under such faculty member considering the placements opportunities. So, they should not complain afterwards.
I believe about 70-80% of faculty members at IITs are good. Many of them are well respected even outside. 

There is definitely a competition among faculty members to get reaearch students. Publication record is one of the main criterion for promotion.
Depending on the dept, number of good publications count could be high or low. In experimental research, the research students are key to publication.
A participation of a faculty member in experimental research can be at best slightly better than the job of a research manager. As I said the
research grant is key to any experiment oriented research. So, lab setup an sourcing chemical reagents, equipment and associated devices require
an external grant. The institute does not have any echo-system to support a faculty member in it. So, apart from intellectual contribution a
faculty member is supposed to accomplish everything within first 3 years of their tenure at IITs. If the dept head is good or works in the same
area then the faculty member may get a sympathetic vibe by agreeing to share credits. Nothing comes without a price. So, starting a career as 
a young faculty member at IITs is no better or no worse than anywhere in the world. Matching research students to the interest of a faculty 
member could itself trigger a competion. Matching process could be open or based on certain criterion for equitable distribution. The
depts where matching process is open, the competition is more intense and poaching happens. However equitable distribution is also fraught with
problems where a student may have to join a least preferred professor and get demotivated. I have no straightforward solution to it. Let me  
deal a bit research agenda. For example, in Computer Science, the agend is set by big companies like Google and Microsoft. All undergraduate students
these days want to work in AI/ML and Data Science. I have discussed about it in an earlier blog. A CS undergraduate from schools outside IITs
do not even have good programming background but want to work in AI/ML or Data  Sciences. I learn from a young faculty member at one of older
IITs that it is impossible to get any student who would work in the faculty member's area of interest. So, all of them now work in AI/ML and
Data Sciences. It kills quality research. Only B grade research gets reported. I am not sure who to blame for it. Beyond CSE, research in
sciences at IITs is no better. I remember that I was traveling in company with a well-known professor in chemistry who
bored me all the way and 1/6 the of whole day (4 hours) on the politics denied him an SSB award. So, I do agree the description which
is circulating about a typical Science faculty member at older IITs. However, my experience with collaborative research with scientist in US universities, 
Europe and Oceania tells me the problem is not typical to India or at IITs. Sometime back in an earlier blog I referred to a movie called 
PHD (pile higher and deeper). It sums up the life of a typical research student in an American University. So, to say that US universities are
better is a myth. No one looks at the root cause, you decide to pursue a Ph. D at IITs then you have chosen to do so. Cribbing about it only
reflects your frustration. Any system has its fair share of good and bad. There are also as much good souls at older IITs at they are at US
universities. It is either your luck or simply a bad choice to find a good supervisor. The blame squarely lies on you. It is like the wretched
politicians we vote for. People deserve the leader they vote for.
