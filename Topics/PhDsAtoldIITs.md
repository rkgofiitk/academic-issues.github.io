# Pursuing Ph. D. at IITs

The purpose of this blog is to dispell some of the disinformation that is being circulated in a few social network sites. Quora is one of these.
Quora is a site where people ask questions and others write answers. Sometime the answers are kind of targeted in a way to rundown an organization
or an enterprise with a vengence. It is apparent from the answer that a balanced view is missing and the attempt is well orchestrated attempts
to target an well-established organization with a bias. There are so called "influencers" who pick it up threads according to their own agenda
and story gets retold exponentially leading to unrepairable damage. In one of the blogs, I did write about certain undesirable practices that
many decorated scientists indulge in. However, that is not a generalization of the fact that some people try to propagate about Ph. Ds at IITs.
So, this blog is an attempt to straighten out facts. 

One responder write never ever think of pursuing Ph. Ds at IIT. He reasons out that professors in older IITs he had a terrible experience. Well,
he did not quite name the specific IIT. But the set of older IITs consists of IITK, IITD, IITM, IITB, IIT-KGP, IITG. I have first hand experience
at least in three of these older IITs, as a student and as a faculty. So, I know the system like plam of my hand. I will restrict my blog by
focusing on the following points.

- Quality of students who opt of Ph. Ds at IITs
- Research grants for Ph. Ds at IITs 
- State of infrastructure at IITs
- Quality of professors at IITs
- Competition among professor to at IITs to get students
- Opportunities for publications for research orginating from India

Top undergraduate students in engineering who get placements and will be very reluctant to go for Ph. Ds unless they are specifically inclined. 
I believe at older IITs placement record will be close to 80% if not more. Many undergraduate students work in freelance mode and try their 
hands in startups. Of course that number will be pretty small. So, let us say about 20% of undergraduates in engineering will be interested for
Ph. Ds. However, most of them try universtities abroad. My estimate is about 2% (in CS) undergraducates will ever go for Ph. Ds at IIT. So, 
the input to Ph. Ds at IIT is from colleges outside IIT system and mainly in science or humanities. Let us understand that our university
system is messed up completely. I believe 95-97% of the private institutions operate only with very poor quality faculty and govt (its regulatory
agencies like AICTE or UGC) does n't care. Most of the good students will sit for GRE and will opt for admission outside India. Hence, the quality
of students who come for Ph. Ds at IIT is not any great. Sometimes background is a problem. I am not passing a judgement here. My conclusion
is based on the fact who seem statistically plausible with a caveat that I don't have numbers to back it.

About second point, all institutions in India depend on grants from Govt agenecies. Very few private enterprise help with CSR fund. However, 
most enterprise plough their CSR funds to captive educational setups or startups. CSR came under companies act only in 2013. About 80% of govt
grants to IITs is for salaries. Only 20% of the grant is utilised for IIT  in recurring expenses and capex kind of funding. Recurring expense
include maintenance such as IWD, electricity, AMCs, etc. I guess it won't be more than 100cr per older IITs. The major flow of fund in research
or infrastructure upgrade comes under HEFA loan. If someone knows about it can understand the implication of a loan versus a grant. In simple 
terms it means most successful researchers in IITs depend on project grants unless they are doing pen-paper kind of stuff.
