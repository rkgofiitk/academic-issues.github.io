# Pursuing Ph. D. at IITs

The purpose of this blog is to dispel some of the disinformation being circulated on a few social networking sites. Quora is one of these.
Quora is a site where people ask questions, and others write answers. Sometimes both the questions the answers are specifically targeted
to rundown an organization or an enterprise with a vengeance. It becomes apparent from a response that a balanced view is missing, and 
the attempt is well-orchestrated with a bias. There are so-called "influencers" who pick it up threads according to their agenda, and the story 
gets retold exponentially, leading to irrepairable damages. In [one of the blogs, I wrote about certain undesirable practices that
many decorated scientists indulge in](../PhDstudents.md). However, that is not a generalization of the fact that some people try to propagate 
about Ph. D program at IITs. So, this blog is an attempt to straighten out the facts. 

An understandably peeved responder writes that one should never pursue Ph. Ds at IIT. He reasons that he had terrible 
experiences working his supervisor while pursuing Ph. D at one of the older IITs. Well, he needed to name the specific IIT and the discipline.
It would save some poor souls of at least a few freshmen. It is well-known that the older IITs consist of IITK, IITD, IITM, IITB, IIT-KGP, and IITG.
I have first-hand experience as a student and faculty member, at least in three of these older IITs. So, I know the system like the palm of my hand. 
I will restrict my blog by focusing on the following points.

- Quality of students who opt for Ph. Ds at IITs
- Research grants for Ph. Ds at IITs 
- State of infrastructure at IITs
- Quality of professors at IITs
- Competition among professors at IITs to get students
- Opportunities for publications for research originating from India

Top undergraduate students in engineering get good placements and will be too reluctant to go for Ph. Ds unless they are specifically inclined. 
Any older IIT's placement record will be as high as 80%, if not more. Many undergraduate students work in freelance mode and try their 
hands at startups. Of course, that number will be small. So, let us say about 20% of undergraduates in engineering will be interested in
Ph. Ds. Most of them try for admissions into universities abroad (mainly in US). Ph. D. is a commitment for 4-5 years. Many will hang out 
for a year or so before deciding to join in Ph. Ds. I guess many also leave in the midway before completion. I estimate that about 2% (in C.S.)
of undergraduates will ever go for Ph. D.s at IITs. So, the input to Ph. Ds at IITs is from colleges outside the IIT system, and mainly in science
or humanities. Our university system is messed up completely. 95-97 % of the private institutions operate with very poor quality faculty, and 
the govt (its regulatory agencies, like AICTE or UGC) don't care. Hence, the quality of students who come for Ph. Ds at IITs is not great. 
Sometimes the background is a problem. I am not passing judgment here. My conclusion is based on the facts that it is statistically plausible
with the caveat that I don't have numbers to back it.

About the second point, all institutions in India depend on grants from Govt agencies. Very few private enterprise help with CSR funds. CSR came
under the Companies Act only in 2013. However, most enterprises plough their CSR funds into captive educational startups.  About 80% of govt
grants to IITs are for salaries. Only 20% of the grant is utilized for recurring expenses and capex funding. The recurring expenses
include maintenance such as IWD (institute works dept), electricity, AMCs (annual maintenance contract), etc. I guess IWD spendings won't be more 
than 150cr per older IIT. The major flow of funds in research, capacity building, infrastructure upgrade comes under the HEFA loans. If 
someone knows about it can understand the implication of a loan versus a grant. In simple terms, it means most successful researchers in IITs 
depend on extramural research grants unless they are doing pen-paper kind of stuff as mathematicians do!

Let us elaborate on the quality of professors at IITs. Getting quality faculty is always a big problem. However, Delhi, Bombay, and Madras never
had a problem attracting the best people. Kanpur, Kharagpur, and Guwahati had difficulties due to their locations. Even with locational
disadvantages, Kanpur and Kharagpur did well. Kanpur's first director PK Kelkar had a vision and made a few tweaks to rules which attracted
excellent faculty. Now the autonomy of IITs is a myth; such tweaking of rules is impossible, and the successive govts spiked the selection process 
to get unscrupulous undeserving people with political connections to become directors.  I explained the 
[selection process of the directors in an earlier blog](../universityChiefExecutive.md). Even with the useless non-leader, the intrinsic strength 
of the IITs was an effective safeguard. We could successfully preserve Advance JEE structure against the machination of MHRD and the colluding
directors. Unfortunately, it is no more the case today. IIT senates have lost their strengths. Perhaps many things may not be ok with the 
selection process of faculty members. Good teachers are not encouraged anymore. Ranking of education institution do not have a component for
good teaching. Though publication record used to be a criterion earlier too, it was not overly emphasized. Awards were encouraged, but not to
the extent it is now. I know the SSB (shanti swarup bhatnagar) awardees now aspire and actively lobby to become administrative heads or 
influencers. Awards never make a soul good unless the person is genetically good. In fact, Prof B. Nag is one of the best diretors at IITB. He was 
neither a SSB awardee nor a well decorated scientist. He had a vision and acknowledged as a leader of exceptional calibre. Bad managers bring
a bad name to the whole institution with bad publicity and a fair share of legal troubles as many of the older IITs have now. I agree that some 
faculty members run after awards and publications and indulge in internecine politics. Their students suffer due to it. Yet, one 
can easily spot them. If students fall prey to their charms and fame, they do suffer. Many such faculty members even use their existing students
as recruiters for freshmen. However, talking outside the clique, one  may find bits of truth and conclude. Once an unscrupulous faculty member 
traps students, things can go terribly wrong for them. I know a few who became nervous wrecks. However, I have also seen the 
other side of the story. Many students want to work under such faculty members considering the placement opportunities. So, they should not complain 
afterward. About 70-80 % of faculty members at IITs are good. Many of them are well respected even outside. 

There is a competition among faculty members to get research students. Publication record is one of the main criteria for promotion.
The requirement for good publications could be high or low depending on the discipline. In experimental research, the research students are key
to publication. The participation of a faculty member in experimental research can be slightly better than that of a research manager. As I said, the
research grant is vital to any experiment-oriented research. So, lab setup and sourcing chemical reagents, equipment, and associated devices require
an external grant. The institute does not have any echosystem to support a faculty member. So, apart from intellectual contribution, a
faculty member is supposed to accomplish everything within the first three years of their tenure at IITs. If the dept head is good or works in the 
same area, the faculty member may get a sympathetic vibe but only by agreeing to share credits. Nothing ever comes free. So, starting a career as 
a young faculty member at IIT is no better or worse than anywhere in the world. Matching fresh research students to a faculty member's interest could 
trigger a competition. The matching process could be open or based on the criterion of equitable distribution. The competition is more intense in the
depts where the matching process is open, and poaching happens. However, equitable distribution is also fraught with
problems where students may have to join a least preferred professor and get demotivated. I have no straightforward solution to it. I know 
one of the new IITs is experimenting with a supervisor matching algorithm which they call "hunger algorithm." The algorithm has not proved
any good except for landing a student under care of an unwilling professor. 

Let me deal a bit with research agenda. For example, in Computer Science, the agenda is set by big companies like Google and Microsoft. 
All undergraduate students want to work in AI/ML and Data Science. I have discussed it in an [earlier blog](../AI-ML-DataScience.md). 
A CS undergraduate from schools outside the IIT system does not even have a good programming background but wants to work in AI/ML or Data 
Sciences. I learned from a young faculty member at one of the older IITs that getting a student who would work in the faculty member's area 
of interest is impossible. So, all the faculty members now work in AI/ML and Data Sciences. It kills quality research in core area. Only 
B-grade research gets reported in AI/ML. I don't know who to blame for it. Beyond CSE, research in sciences at IITs is no better. I remember 
traveling in the company of a well-known professor in chemistry who bored me all the way, and 1/6 of the whole day (4 hours) on the politics 
that denied him an SSB award. So, I agree with the description circulating about a typical Science faculty member at older IITs. However, my 
experience with collaborative research with scientists in U.S. universities, Europe and Oceania tells me the problem is not typical to India 
or IITs. Sometime back in an earlier blog, I referred to a movie called 
[P.H.D. (Pile Higher and Deeper)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMFKu8ies0c). It sums up the life of a typical research student in an 
American University. So, to say that the US universities are better is a myth. In European system, a professor is an institution. It is
even more difficult to go against a professor unless you want to sacrifice your life! No one looks at the root cause; if you decide to pursue a 
Ph. D at IITs, you have chosen to do so. Cribbing about it only reflects your frustration. Any system has its fair share of good, bad and ugly. 
Percentage-wise, there are also as many good souls at older IITs as at any US university. Finding a good supervisor is a mature well-reasoned 
choice rather than swimming along with a bandwagon. The blame squarely lies on the concerned student. It is like the wretched politicians 
we vote for. People deserve the leader they vote for.

The last point is the opportunities for research publications originating from India. India does not have an ecosystem for peer evaluation or
research publications. All journals and top-grade conferences are controlled by the researchers and their caucus from the USA, Canada, or European 
Nations. [Scimago](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php) ranking scheme is accepted worldwide. Scimago lists a total of 482 journals 
from India. It lists only twelve of the Indian journals in category Q1. The majority of the journals from India are ranked in the category Q4.
As far as computer science is concerned, Scimago lists only eleven journals. None of them belong to the Q1 category. Naturally, getting a publication 
from India is more challenging than from the USA, Canada, Europe, or Australia. One needs to be in the good network of peers or share
credits of publications with researchers from outside India. It not only hurts to share credits but unethical to do so.
