CACM January 2025 issue will carry an insightful discussion on "Crisis of Ethics" in computing by Moshe Vardi. The article deals with what Vardi terms as
change of view concerning crisis of ethics in computing. The article quotes wall street columnist Peggy Noonan's diatribe against Silicon Valley Executives
after the Guardian and the New York Times broke the story on Cambridge Analytica engineered data breach of Facebook. Noonan quipped that the
Silicon Valley executives consider themselves as "moral Martians who operate on some weird new postmodern ethical wavelength."  Niall Ferguson,
a Hoover Institution historian, described cyberspace as "cyberia, a dark and lawless realm where malevolent actors range." The outrage concerning the
Facebook databreach came in context of Cambridge Analytica's election meddlings.

Cambridge Analytica is a British Political Consulting Company establised in 2013.It could microtarget people on Facebook from 2010 and roll out an open graph with 
the accociated APIs that can access data and features from one application to another. Cambridge Analytica's model was developed using 90 million 
Facebook users. The developer can see connection between people, social groups, activities, interests, demographic attributes, etc using their API. Obama's
campaign reportedly developed an application that connected Obama's supporters to his potential supporters. The Times of India report on 27th March 2018
also says that company worked extensively with Congress Party for Indian Election as per whistle blower 
[Christopher Wylie's testimony](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whistleblower-names-congress-as-client-of-cambridge-analytica/articleshow/63491689.cmsin) 
in British Parliament.

A Cambridge Univsersity researcher Aleksandar Kogan 
used the Cambridge Analytica API tool to determine what may affect behavior of Facebook users. The research data was later shared with Cambridge Analytica. 
In March 2018 the Guardian and the New York Times reported broke the story about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook data breach.  

In 2014 employees and contractors of Cambridge Analytica were trying to sell psychological profiles of American voters to the polical campaigns by harvesting
Facebook data. In a companion report, it was claimed that Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate SCI group
were in touch with executives of Lukoil, a Russian oil giant, which was interested in the way American voters may vote.
