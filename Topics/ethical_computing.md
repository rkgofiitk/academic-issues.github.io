# Ethical Computing

[Blog Index](../index.md)

CACM January 2025 issue carries an insightful discussion on "Crisis of Ethics" in computing by Moshe Vardi. Vardi candidly expresses significant
change in his view on "crisis of ethics" in computing. The article begins with quote from wall street columnist Peggy Noonan
after the Guardian and the New York Times broke the story on Cambridge Analytica engineered data breach of Facebook. Noonan quipped that the
Silicon Valley executives consider themselves as "moral Martians who operate on some weird new postmodern ethical wavelength."  Niall Ferguson,
a Hoover Institution historian, described cyberspace as "cyberia (parody of syberia), a dark and lawless realm where malevolent actors range." 
The outrages of the two commentators were in the context of Cambridge Analytica's successful a business model built on the harvested demographic
data in elections of US, India and other countries by large-scale hacking of Facebook.

Cambridge Analytica is a British Political Consulting Company establised in 2013.It could microtarget people on Facebook from 2010 and roll out an
open graph with the accociated APIs that can access data and features from one application to another. Cambridge Analytica's model was developed using
90 million Facebook users. The developer can see connection between people, social groups, activities, interests, demographic attributes, etc., using their 
API.In 2014 employees and contractors of Cambridge Analytica were trying to sell psychological profiles of American voters to the polical campaigns.
In a companion report, it was claimed that Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate SCI group were in touch with executives of Lukoil,
a Russian oil giant, which was interested in the way Americans may vote. Obama's campaign reportedly developed an application that connected 
Obama's supporters to his potential supporters. Cambridge Analytic meedled extensicely with Indian election. On 27th March, 2018, the Times of India 
reported that company worked extensively with Congress Party for Indian Election as per whistle blower 
[Christopher Wylie's testimony](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whistleblower-names-congress-as-client-of-cambridge-analytica/articleshow/63491689.cmsin) 
in British Parliament. 

A Cambridge Univsersity researcher Aleksandar Kogan used the Cambridge Analytica API tool to determine what may affect behavior of Facebook users. 
The research data was later shared with Cambridge Analytica. It is not clear, in what way Cambridge Analytica benefitted from Kogan's research. But 
clearly opened avenues for large scale unethical computing which can influence a country's political power structure and make them permanently 
unstable due to business models of big tech companies.

Vardi's aricle further narrates the story of Uber centered around it founder Tarvis Kalanick's unethical computing practices.  In 2023, Kalanick lauded
as a person who made services oriented to serve humanity.  According to a report of a popular magazine "... Travis Kalanick, had built
an enormous, enthusiastic user base by subsidizing rides with the companyâ€™s vast reservoir of VC funding. Under Kalanick, Uber skirted regulations, 
shrugged off safety issues, and presided over a workplace rife with sexual harassment."  The misdeeds of Kalanick were exposed by a whitle blower
who leaked more than 124,000 company files to the Guardian. 

Both Cambridge Analytica and Uber stories about unethical computing were driven by profit motivation. Is profit motivation against public good? 
Moshe's article quotes [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith), a scotish philosopher and economist of 18th century who pioneered thinking 
in political economy who said "They are led by an invisible hand ...and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society."
Vardi opines that Adam Smith's theory of "free market always serves public good" has no theoretical basis. According to him "Climate crisis has demonstrated 
failure of free market." Similarly, Big Tobacco companies are surely not working for public good. Moshe Vardi's article identifies that "ethical
practices" as the thin line between free market and public good. Crisis of ethics can be devastating if one choose to extend the theory of free 
market or unfettered business models on the top of AI/ML and big data analytics in guise of public good.

Coming back to question of crisis of ethics in computing, let us draw the parallel from unethical nuclear research. While nuclear power reactors led to 
energy sufficiency and reduction of carbon footprint and cancer treatment, nuclear explosion was responsible for unimaginable holocausts like Nagasaki and
Hiroshima. About nine countries including India now possess nuclear weapon capabilities. Yet there has not been a single use of nuclear weapon after 1945. 
Many commentators argue that nuclear capabilities act more a deterrent than destruction. I am not sure how Moshe Vardi will view this analogy with
respect to unethical computing.  US president Roosevelt who ordered the dropping of nuclear bomb in 1945, was the most popular US President. He was elected 
four times and probably would have ruled US 20 years had he been a little younger and did not die 2 years into his fourth term. Interestingly, US 
constitution was amended after Roosevelt.  The quest is: why do US citizens think Roosevelt was so good? Does it mean a majority US citizens suffer from
crisis of ethics? 

My view is that scientific research should not be shackled. Almost all will agree that all religions strongly support practice of ethics in all speheres
human society including scientific research. Science and theology has coexisted often in harmony. Though the conflicts between Galileo and Copernicus with
Church is well documented. Cathilic Church banned Copernicus's theory and warned Galileo, but it could not stop the direction of scientific research.
According to a [pew research document](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/08/26/on-the-intersection-of-science-and-religion/) conflict between
science and religion is mostly hyped. While Hindus think science and theology are complementary spheres, Buddhists isolate the two spheres. However, 
Buddhists cannot identify any scientific research that come in they way of their relgious scriptures. Muslims say that science and Islam are generally 
compatible though some areas in science like evolutionary theory is in conflict with their relgious beliefs.  

Moshe Vardi quotes political activist Sinclair. According to Sinclair "it is difficult for a person to understand something when their salary depends on
not understanding it." Vardi says that by and large big Tech workders do not ask hard questions which they should be asking on the business models that
the company wants to pursue. In conclusion there is a serious crisis of ethics in computing. I am not sure if Vardi will push for a course in ethics as
a part of computer science course curriculum. However, I believe that no amount of course or teaching will ever eliminate crisis of ethics in any spehere
of human life. In my opinion ethics and worldly requiremennts of existence are at times orthogonal to an ordinary person's life. So, crisis of ethics
