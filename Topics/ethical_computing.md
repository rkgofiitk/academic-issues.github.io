# Ethical Computing

[Blog Index](../index.md)

CACM January 2025 issue will carry an insightful discussion on "Crisis of Ethics" in computing by Moshe Vardi. The article deals with what Vardi terms as
change of his view on "crisis of ethics" in computing. The article begins with quote from wall street columnist Peggy Noonan
after the Guardian and the New York Times broke the story on Cambridge Analytica engineered data breach of Facebook. Noonan has quipped that the
Silicon Valley executives consider themselves as "moral Martians who operate on some weird new postmodern ethical wavelength."  Niall Ferguson,
a Hoover Institution historian, described cyberspace as "cyberia, a dark and lawless realm where malevolent actors range." The outrages of the
commentators were in the context of Cambridge Analytica's successful attempts to breach Facebook data for election meddlings in US, India and other
places.

Cambridge Analytica is a British Political Consulting Company establised in 2013.It could microtarget people on Facebook from 2010 and roll out an
open graph with the accociated APIs that can access data and features from one application to another. Cambridge Analytica's model was developed using
90 million Facebook users. The developer can see connection between people, social groups, activities, interests, demographic attributes, etc using their 
API.In 2014 employees and contractors of Cambridge Analytica were trying to sell psychological profiles of American voters to the polical campaigns by harvesting
Facebook data. In a companion report, it was claimed that Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate SCI groupwere in touch with executives of Lukoil,
a Russian oil giant, which was interested in the way American voters may vote. Obama's campaign reportedly developed an application that connected 
Obama's supporters to his potential supporters. Cambridge Analytica also meedled extensicely with Indian election. On 27th March, 2018, the Times of India 
reported that company worked extensively with Congress Party for Indian Election as per whistle blower 
[Christopher Wylie's testimony](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whistleblower-names-congress-as-client-of-cambridge-analytica/articleshow/63491689.cmsin) 
in British Parliament. 

A Cambridge Univsersity researcher Aleksandar Kogan used the Cambridge Analytica API tool to determine what may affect behavior of Facebook users. 
The research data was later shared with Cambridge Analytica. It is not clear, in what way Cambridge Analytica benefitted from Kogan's research. But 
clearly opened avenues for large scale unethical computing which can influence a country's political power structure and make them permanently 
unstable due to business models of big tech companies.

Vardi's aricle further narrates the story of Uber centered around it founder Tarvis Kalanick's unethical computing practices.  In 2023, Kalanick lauded
as a person who made services oriented to serve humanity.  According to a report of a popular magazine "... Travis Kalanick, had built
an enormous, enthusiastic user base by subsidizing rides with the companyâ€™s vast reservoir of VC funding. Under Kalanick, Uber skirted regulations, 
shrugged off safety issues, and presided over a workplace rife with sexual harassment."  The misdeeds of Kalanick were exposed by a whitle blower
who leaked more than 124,000 company files to the Guardian. 

Both Cambridge Analytica and Uber stories about unethical computing were driven by profit motivation. Is profit motivation against public good? 
Moshe's article quotes [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith), a scotish philosopher and economist of 18th century who pioneered thinking 
in political economy who said "They are led by an invisible hand ...and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society."
Vardi opines that Adam Smith's theory of "free market always serves public good" has no theoretical basis. According to him "Climate crisis has demonstrated 
failure of free market." Similarly, Big Tobacco companies are surely not for public good. Basically, Moshe Vardi's article clearly identifies "ethical
practices" as the thin dividing line between free market and public good. 

Coming back to question of crisis of ethics in computing, we can draw a parallel from unethical neuclear research. While neuclear power reactors led to 
energy sufficiency and reduction of carbon footprint and cancer treatment it also is responsible for creating holocausts like Nagasaki and
Hiroshima. About nine countries including India now have nuclear weapon capabilities. Yet there has not been a single use of nuclear weapon after 1945. 
People may also argue that nuclear capabilities act more a deterrent than destruction. I am not sure how Moshe Vardi will view this analogy with
respect to unethical computing. However, I view it in backdrop of holocaust that happened in 1945. US president Roosevelt who ordered dropping of
nuclear bomb was most popular President of US who was elected four times and probably would have rule US five times had he been a little younger and did 
die 2 years into his 4th term. Interestingly, US constitution was amended precisely due to Roosevelt episode. My view is that scientific research
should not be shackled, it should be left to personal ethics of researchers how they conduct themselves in steering their research.
