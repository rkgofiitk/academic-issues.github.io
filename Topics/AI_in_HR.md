## AI Applications for Handling Recruitments

Today, I came across an insightful post from one my former students on LinkedIn. He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition in companies. AI can influence the following six aspects of
talent acquisition strategies of a company:
- AI can use Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- AI can help automated candidate resourcing
- AI can eliminate recruitment biases
- AI can assist in analysis and forecasting workforce trend
- AI can help HR strategize future talent acquisition

I am sure that many mid-sized companies are already using certain in-house predictive technology in 
talent acquisition. Many companies in the past or even today are using statistical methods for 
predicting the performance trends of existing workforce. However, the exercise remained in the domain 
of policy makers who used for the purpose of presentation to their CEO and other top-level company
executives. It allowed them to let go deadwoods and reassign workforce depending on requirement of
new product requirements and upgrades. However, I am not sure how much of that analysis were put in
use in practice. At the end of the day, perceptions and informal chatroom discussions were reliable
source for talent acquisition. I had an interesting informal talk with a highly place company executive.
He was sharing the reasons for many companies relying heavily on campus placements, especially, those
in software business. Many such companies do not give much importance to candidate's academic grade.
They evaluate the candidates on the basis of extra-curricular activities and brand-value of the
institutions. Since each company has an apprentice program, they need not spend much effort time and
energy in talent acquisition. The arguments in such a strategy are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good if they could enter such institutions.
- Weak candidates anyway cannot survive the company's internship program.

The two points stated above are simple, yet powerful SOP for talent acquisition which have remained
the core hirings principles through campus placements of most companies. However, AI brings
sophistication in talent acquisition process. The AI-powered SOP for recruitments saves a company
from subsequent embarassment of probable poor recruitments due to a misjudgement of human recruiters. 
If AI-powered predictive analytics are used then a company would perhaps be able to create pseudo 
profiles of future talent requirements. The actual profiles of job applicants can
then be matched with the mined profiles to prepare a shortlist of prospective candidates. I do not
know if any large recuriter is actually following such a process, but it looks very promising. However,
the basic assumption for AI-based predictive analytics to work is that we have enough data to create 
pseudo profiles and mine them. Whether a company will share them is debatable. Therefore, premise 
behind such a conclusion is that each company will have to develop analytics on their own data. In that
case can the approach be generic enough? First, we need to create sufficient abstractions for developing
the set of AI-based predictive analytics. These cannot be any different from statics based predictive
analytics couple with a bit of automated reasoning theory.  

I believe candidate resourcing could be easy through automated tools. Though it might not be possible 
to pick actual identity of candidates, it would be fairly simple to gather enough information from
many published web resources and social media activities of people, where they graduated from and which
organizations they belong.

Complete elimination of recruitment biases may not be very desirable at times. An ideal candidates is 
not the best one to recruit. The suitability of a candidate would depend largely on environment. The 
environment would include personal space, work space and societal space. The complex interplay of 
these spaces may cloud psycho-analytic evaluation of a candidate's suitability for a particular job.
Human decision makers use unexplanable instincts on a candidate's worthiness under constrained
environmental conditions. I doubt whether even explanable AI techniques can make such a decision. 
However, I believe, AI can largely eliminate things like conflict of interests, nepotism, cronyism and
other human frailities in favoring a candidate.

Analysis and forecasting workforce trend are fairly straightforward. Clearly, AI has an edge over 
human assisted techniques. Many statistical techniques exists in this space. AI technique would rely
on these technique but can make much smarter analysis.
