## AI Applications for Handling Recruitments

Today, I came across an insightful post from one my former students on LinkedIn. He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition by HR depts. The six aspects of talent acquisition strategies 
where AI may help are:
- Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- Automated candidate resourcing
- Elimination of recruitment biases
- Analysis and forecasting workforce trend
- Strategizing future talent acquisition

I am sure that many mid-sized companies are already using certain in-house predictive analysis in 
talent acquisition. Many companies in the past or even today are using substantially involved
statistical packages to predict the performance trends of existing workforce. However, these 
exercises remained in the domain of policy makers who used for the purpose of evaluating where
the enterprise or the organization is headed. It allowed them to let plan for reassigning workforce
depending on requirement of new product requirements and upgrades. However, I am not sure how much
of that analysis were put in use in practice for predicting talent requirements. At the end of the
day, perceptions and informal chatroom discussions are deemed reliable pointers for talent 
acquisition. I had an interesting informal talk with a highly placed company executive in Siemens Ltd.
I gathered that many established companies rely heavily on campus placements at prestigeous 
institutions like IITs or NIITs. Even many such companies are not bothered much about candidate's
academic grade. They evaluate the candidates on the basis of extra-curricular activities and 
brand-value of the institutions. Most companies has a sufficiently rigorous induction program that 
settles the whether the candidate finally makes it to finish line. So, they need not spend much
effort time and energy in talent acquisition. The arguments in such a strategy are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good, if they were admitted to such institutions.
- Weak candidates anyway cannot survive the company's rigorous induction program.

The above two points are simple, yet powerful SOP for talent acquisition which have remained
the core hirings principles through campus placements of most companies. However, the focus of 
recruitment is talent acquisition from IITs and NITs that use JEE advance scores for entrance. 
Therefore, it is no brainer to understand the recruiters rely on it. Unfortunately, the recruiters
would not have luxry of relying exclusively on campus placements at other a few hundred other 
institutions though there may be extremely talented candidates. If AI-powered predictive analytics
are used then a company would perhaps be able to create pseudo profiles of future talent 
requirements. The actual profiles of job applicants can then be matched with the mined profiles 
to produce a shortlist of prospective candidates without human intervention. I do not
know if any large recuriter is actually following such a process, but it looks very promising. 
The basic assumption for AI-based predictive analytics to work is that enough data exists to create 
pseudo profiles and mine them. Whether the recruiters would share them is debatable. Therefore, the 
premise behind such a conclusion is that each company will have to develop analytics on their own
data. In that case can the approach be generic enough? I believe it is possible. At first, we need 
to create sufficient abstractions for developing the set of AI-based predictive analytics. These
cannot be any different from statics based predictive analytics coupled with the principles of
automated reasoning. The next step is training with data. This step can be performed and customised for
each enterprise. 

I believe candidate resourcing could be easy through automated tools. Though it might not be possible 
to pick actual identity of candidates, it would be fairly simple to gather enough information from
many published web resources and social media activities of people, where they graduated from, to which
organizations they belong, their facebook/instagram profiles, the interest groups they are associated
with, and so on. 

Complete elimination of recruitment biases may not be very desirable at times. An ideal candidates is 
not the best one to recruit. The suitability of a candidate would depend largely on environment. The 
environment would include personal space, work space and societal space. The complex interplay of 
these spaces may cloud psycho-analytic evaluation of a candidate's suitability for a particular job.
Human decision makers use unexplanable instincts on a candidate's worthiness under constrained
environmental conditions. I doubt whether even explanable AI techniques can make such a decision. 
However, I believe, AI can largely eliminate things like conflict of interests, nepotism, cronyism and
other human frailities in favoring a candidate.

Analysis and forecasting workforce trend are fairly straightforward. Clearly, AI has an edge over 
human assisted techniques. Many statistical techniques exists in this space. AI technique would rely
on these technique but can make much smarter analysis.
