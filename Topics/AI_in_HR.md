## Applications of AI in Talent Acquisition

Recently, I came across [an insightful post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prashantprashant_aiinhr-talentacquisition-hrtech-activity-7183099179295027200-7Wn7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) from [one of my former students](https://in.linkedin.com/in/prashantprashant?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name). He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition. The six aspects of talent acquisition strategies 
where AI may help are:
- Assessing talent requirements through predictive analytics
- Automated candidate resourcing
- Elimination of recruitment biases
- Analysis and forecasting of workforce trend
- Strategizing future talent acquisition

Many mid-sized companies already use specific in-house predictive analytics for  
talent acquisition. In the past, or even today, some of these companies have used statistical packages
like SPSS for data-driven decision-making, breaking the silos created by various systems and tools. 
However, these exercises remained in the domain of policymakers, who used them to evaluate where
the enterprise or the organization was headed. It allowed them to plan for reassigning the workforce
depending on the requirements of new product and upgrades of existing products. However, I don't 
know how much of SPSS based predictive analytics was used in practice for talent acquisition. 

Perceptions and informal chatroom discussions are deemed reliable pointers to talent acquisition. 
Sometime in the past, I had an interesting informal talk with a highly-placed company executive at 
Siemens Ltd. I gathered that many established companies rely on campus placements at prestigious 
institutions like IITs or NITs. They are not unduly bothered about candidate's academic grades. 
They evaluate the candidates based on extra-curricular activities and the supposedly high brand 
value of the institutions they come from. Most companies have a sufficiently rigorous induction 
program that settles whether a candidate reach the finish line for induction. So they can 
spend little effort, time, and energy on talent acquisition. The arguments for such a strategy are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good if they could get admissions into "good" institutions.
- Weak candidates cannot survive the company's rigorous induction program.

The above two points are simple yet powerful SOPs for talent acquisition, and have remained
the core hiring principles of most companies in campus placements from IITs,  NITs, and a handful of 
institutions that use JEE advance scores for admission. It is no brainer to understand why the
recruiters rely on it. Unfortunately, such a relaxed approach to talent acquisition is not possible
for campus placements at hundreds of other middle-tier institutions. There may be highly talented 
candidates in these institutions who are better than the average candidates from IITs and NITs. 
AI-based predictive analytics allows the creation and mining pseudo profiles of exact talent 
requirements. The profiles of actual job applicants can be matched with the mined profiles to produce
a shortlist of prospective candidates without human intervention. I don't know if any large 
recruiter is following such a process, but it looks promising. The basic assumption for AI-based 
predictive analytics to work is that enough data exists to create pseudo profiles and mine them. 
Whether the recruiters would share data is debatable. Therefore, the 
premise behind such a conclusion is that each company must develop analytics on its available 
data. In that case, can the approach be generic enough? Yes, it is possible. First, we need 
to create sufficient abstractions to build the set of AI-based predictive analytics. These
cannot be any different from statistical methods for predictive analytics coupled with the principles 
of automated reasoning. The next step is training with data, which can be performed over synthetically
generated data and customized as per the requirements of an enterprise. 

Candidate resourcing could be easy through automated tools. Though it might not always be possible 
identify actual candidates, it would be pretty simple to gather enough information from
many published resources which include:
- The institutions from where the candidates graduated, 
- The organizations they belong to,
- Facebook/Instagram profiles of the candidates,
- Social media activities of the candidates,
- The interest groups the candidates are associated with, and so on. 

Complete elimination of recruitment biases may not be desirable at times. An ideal candidate is 
sometimes not the best one to recruit. The suitability of a candidate would depend mainly on
the environment. The environment is essentially a three-dimensional space consisting of personal 
space (including the family), workspace, and societal space. The complex interplay of 
these spaces may cloud the psycho-analytic evaluation of a candidate's suitability for a particular job.
Human decision-makers have unexplainable instincts to determine a candidate's worthiness under
constrained environmental conditions. It would be difficult to capture them (human instincts) through 
AI tools or techniques. Yet, AI can eliminate conflict of interest, nepotism, cronyism, and other
human frailties which favor one candidate over another.

Analysis and forecasting of workforce trends are pretty straightforward. AI has an edge over 
human-assisted techniques. Many statistical methods exist in this space. AI techniques would rely
on these methods but can make a much more insightful analysis. HR personnel are always viewed with a 
bit of mistrust by the employees. Sometimes, the employees consider them a part of the problem rather 
than the solution. So, an AI-based tool to evaluate performance is not only 
preferable but affordable too. Besides, the tool can be designed to provide regular personalized
feedback for an individual's career progression.

The last point is also amenable to AI-based predictive analytics. Overall, AI will increasingly
influence talent acquisition in near future. However, AI's effectiveness in detecting 
singularities in any space would still remain a suspect. The singularities in talent 
acquisition can catapult an organization's success in a short span of time. Only an experienced
human decision-maker can spot such outliers in talent acquisition.
