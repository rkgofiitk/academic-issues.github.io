## Applications of AI in Talent Acquisition

Today, I came across an insightful post from one of my former students. He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition by HR depts. The six aspects of talent acquisition strategies 
where AI may help are:
- Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- Automated candidate resourcing
- Elimination of recruitment biases
- Analysis and forecasting of workforce trend
- Strategizing future talent acquisition

Many mid-sized companies already use specific in-house predictive analyses in 
talent acquisition. In the past, or even today, some of them have used substantially involved
statistical packages to predict the performance trends of the existing workforce. However, these 
exercises remained in the domain of policymakers, who used them to evaluate where
the enterprise or the organization was headed. It allowed them to plan for reassigning the workforce
depending on the requirement of new product requirements and upgrades. However, I don't know how much
of that analysis was used in practice to predict talent requirements. 

Perceptions and informal chatroom discussions are deemed reliable pointers to talent acquisition. 
Sometime in the past, I had an interesting informal talk with a highly-placed company executive at 
Siemens Ltd. I gathered that many established companies rely on campus placements at prestigious 
institutions like IITs or NITs. They are not even bothered about candidate's academic grades. 
They evaluate the candidates based on extra-curricular activities and the supposedly high brand 
value of the institutions. Most companies have a sufficiently rigorous induction program that
settles whether a candidate can reach the finish line for induction. So they can spend little
effort, time, and energy on talent acquisition. The arguments for such a strategy are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good if admitted to such institutions.
- Weak candidates cannot survive the company's rigorous induction program.

The above two points are simple yet powerful SOPs for talent acquisition, which have remained
most companies' core hiring principles in campus placements from IITs, NITs and a handful of 
institutions that use JEE advance scores for admission. It is no brainer to understand why the
recruiters rely on it. Unfortunately, such a relaxed approach to talent acquisition is not possible
for campus placements at hundreds of other middle-tier institutions. There may be highly talented 
candidates in these institutions who are better than the average candidates from IITs and NITs. 
AI-based predictice analytics makes it possible to create and mine pseudo profiles of exact talent 
requirements. The profiles of actual job applicants can be matched with the mined profiles to produce
a shortlist of prospective candidates without human intervention. I don't know if any large 
recruiter is following such a process, but it looks promising. The basic assumption for AI-based 
predictive analytics to work is that enough data exists to create pseudo profiles and mine them. 
Whether the recruiters would share data is debatable. Therefore, the 
premise behind such a conclusion is that each company must develop analytics on its available 
data. In that case, can the approach be generic enough? It is possible. First, we need 
to create sufficient abstractions to build the set of AI-based predictive analytics. These
cannot be any different from statistical methods for predictive analytics coupled with the principles of
automated reasoning. The next step is training with data, which can be performed over synthetically
generated data and customized as per the requirements of an enterprise. 

Candidate resourcing could be easy through automated tools. Though it might not be possible 
identify actual candidates, it would be pretty simple to gather enough information from
many published web resources and social media activities of candidates, where they graduated from, 
to which organizations they belong to, Facebook/Instagram profiles of the candidates, and the 
interest groups they are associated with, and so on. 

Complete elimination of recruitment biases may not be desirable at times. An ideal candidate is 
sometimes not the best one to recruit. The suitability of a candidate would depend mainly on
the environment. The environment can be defined as a three-dimensional space consisting of personal 
space (including the family), workspace, and societal space. The complex interplay of 
these spaces may cloud the psycho-analytic evaluation of a candidate's suitability for a particular job.
Human decision-makers have unexplainable instincts to determine a candidate's worthiness under
constrained environmental conditions. It would be difficult to capture them (human instincts) through 
AI tools or techniques. Yet, AI can eliminate conflict of interest, nepotism, 
cronyism, and other human frailties in favoring a candidate over another.

Analysis and forecasting of workforce trends are pretty straightforward. AI has an edge over 
human-assisted techniques. Many statistical methods exist in this space. AI techniques would rely
on these methods but can make a much more insightful analysis. HR personnel are always viewed with a 
bit of mistrust by the employees. Sometimes, the employees consider them a part of the problem rather 
than the problem solvers. So, an AI-based tool to evaluate performance is always 
preferable and affordable. Besides, the tool can provide regular personalized feedback for
individuals' career progression.

The last point is also amenable to AI-based predictive analytics. Overall, AI will
influence talent acquisition shortly. However, AI's effectiveness in detecting 
singularities in any space would remain a suspect. The singularities in talent 
acquisition can catapult an organization's success. Only an experienced human decision-maker 
can spot such outliers in talent acquisition.
