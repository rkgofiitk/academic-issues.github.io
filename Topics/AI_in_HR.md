## AI Applications for Handling Recruitments

Today, I came across an insightful post from one my former students on LinkedIn. He highlighted the application of AI in talent acquisition in companies. He basically listed six points that will change a company's HR strategies completely:
- AI can use Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- AI can help automated candidate resourcing
- It can eliminate recruitment biases
- It can assist in analysis and forecasting workforce trend
- It can help HR to plan strategies for future talent acquisition

I am sure that many mid-sized companies are already using certain in-house predictive technology in planning strategies for talent acquisition. I know many companies have used statistical methods for predicting the performance trends of existing workforce. However,
the exercise remained in the domain of policy makers who used for the purpose of presentation to their CEO and other top-level  long period of time. It allowed them to let go deadwoods and reassign workforce depending on new product requirements and upgrades.
