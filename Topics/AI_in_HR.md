## AI Applications for Handling Recruitments

Today, I came across an insightful post from one my former students on LinkedIn. He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition in companies. AI can influence the following six aspects of
talent acquisition strategies of a company:
- AI can use Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- AI can help automated candidate resourcing
- AI can eliminate recruitment biases
- AI can assist in analysis and forecasting workforce trend
- AI can help HR strategize future talent acquisition

I am sure that many mid-sized companies are already using certain in-house predictive technology in 
talent acquisition. Many companies in the past or even today are using statistical methods for 
predicting the performance trends of existing workforce. However, the exercise remained in the domain 
of policy makers who used for the purpose of presentation to their CEO and other top-level company
executives. It allowed them to let go deadwoods and reassign workforce depending on requirement of
new product requirements and upgrades. However, I am not sure how much of that analysis were put in
use in practice. At the end of the day, perceptions and informal chatroom discussions were reliable
source for talent acquisition. I had an interesting informal talk with a highly place company executive.
He was sharing the reasons for many companies relying heavily on campus placements, especially, those
in software business. Many such companies do not give much importance to candidate's academic grade.
They evaluate the candidates on the basis of extra-curricular activities and brand-value of the
institutions. Since each company has an apprentice program, they need not spend much effort time and
energy in talent acquisition. The arguments in such a strategy are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good if they could enter such institutions.
- Weak candidates anyway cannot survive the company's internship program.

The two points are simple, yet powerful SOP for talent acquisition which have remained the core hirings
principles through campus placement in most companies. However, AI brings sophistication to talent 
acquisition. The AI-powered SOP for recruitments saves a company from subsequent embarassment of bad
recruitments. If AI-powered predictive analytics are used then a company would perhaps be able to 
create exact profiles of future talent requirements. Mining such data the applicants can be matched
with the mined profiles to prepare a shortlist of prospective candidates. I do not know if any large
recuriter is actually doing it, but it looks very promising.
