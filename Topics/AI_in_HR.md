## AI of Applications in Talent Acquisition

Today, I came across an insightful post from one of my former students on LinkedIn. He highlighted the 
application of AI in talent acquisition by HR depts. The six aspects of talent acquisition strategies 
where AI may help are:
- Predictive analytics in talent requirements
- Automated candidate resourcing
- Elimination of recruitment biases
- Analysis and forecasting of workforce trend
- Strategizing future talent acquisition

Many mid-sized companies already use specific in-house predictive analyses in 
talent acquisition. Many companies in the past or even today are using substantially involved
statistical packages to predict the performance trends of the existing workforce. However, these 
exercises remained in the domain of policymakers, who used them to evaluate where
the enterprise or the organization was headed. It allowed them to plan for reassigning the workforce
depending on the requirement of new product requirements and upgrades. However, I don't know how much
of that analysis was used in practice to predict talent requirements. Perceptions and informal chatroom
discussions are deemed reliable pointers for talent acquisition. I had an interesting informal talk 
with a highly-placed company executive at Siemens Ltd. I gathered that many established companies rely 
heavily on campus placements at prestigious institutions like IITs or NIITs. Even many such companies 
are not bothered much about candidate's academic grades. They evaluate the candidates based on extra-
curricular activities and the brand value of the institutions. Most companies have a sufficiently 
rigorous induction program that settles whether the candidate finally makes it to the finish line. So 
they can spend little effort, time, and energy on talent acquisition. The arguments for such a strategy 
are:
- Candidates must be intrinsically good if admitted to such institutions.
- Weak candidates cannot survive the company's rigorous induction program.

The above two points are simple yet powerful SOPs for talent acquisition, which have remained
the core hiring principles through campus placements in most companies. However, recruitment focuses on 
talent acquisition from IITs and NITs that use JEE advance scores for entrance. 
Therefore, it is no brainer to understand why the recruiters rely on it. Unfortunately, the recruiters
would not be able to rely exclusively on campus placements at a few hundred other 
institutions. However, there may be highly talented candidates who are better than IITs and NITs. 
If AI-powered predictive analytics can be used, it would be possible to create pseudo 
profiles of exact talent requirements. The actual profiles of job applicants can then be matched 
with the mined profiles to produce a shortlist of prospective candidates without human intervention. 
I don't know if any large recruiter is following such a process, but it looks promising. 
The basic assumption for AI-based predictive analytics to work is that enough data exists to create 
pseudo profiles and mine them. Whether the recruiters would share them is debatable. Therefore, the 
premise behind such a conclusion is that each company must develop analytics on its 
data. In that case, can the approach be generic enough? First, we need 
to create sufficient abstractions to build the set of AI-based predictive analytics. These
cannot be any different from statical methods for predictive analytics coupled with the principles of
automated reasoning. The next step is training with data. This step can be performed and customized for
each enterprise. 

Candidate resourcing could be easy through automated tools. Though it might not be possible 
identify actual candidates, it would be pretty simple to gather enough information from
many published web resources and social media activities of people, where they graduated from, to which
organizations they belong to, Facebook/Instagram profiles, and the interest groups they are associated
with, and so on. 

Complete elimination of recruitment biases may not be very desirable at times. An ideal candidate is 
sometimes not the best one to recruit. The suitability of a candidate would depend mainly on
the environment. The environment can be defined as a three-dimensional space consisting of personal 
space, including the family, workspace, and societal space. The complex interplay of 
these spaces may cloud the psycho-analytic evaluation of a candidate's suitability for a particular job.
Human decision-makers use unexplainable instincts on a candidate's worthiness under constrained
environmental conditions that would be difficult to capture through AI tools or techniques.
Yet, I believe AI can essentially eliminate things like conflict of interest, nepotism, cronyism, and
other human frailties in favoring a candidate over another.

Analysis and forecasting of workforce trends are pretty straightforward. AI has an edge over 
human-assisted techniques. Many statistical methods exist in this space. AI techniques would rely
on this technique but can make a much more thoughtful analysis. HR personnel are always viewed with a 
bit of mistrust by the employees. Sometimes, the employees consider them a part of the problem rather 
than the problem solvers. So, having an AI-based tool to evaluate performance is always an affordable
and preferable option. Besides, the tool can provide regular personalized feedback for
career progression.

The last point is also amenable to tool-based predictive analytics. Overall, AI will
influence talent acquisition shortly. However, AI's effectiveness in detecting 
singularities in any space would remain a concern. The singularities in talent 
acquisition can catapult an organization's success.
