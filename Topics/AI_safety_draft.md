# AI Safety Draft Released

[Blog Index](../index.md)

AI action summit released International [AI safety Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025) 
in January before Paris AI action Summit. The report is a columination of Bletchley Declaration which called for international 
cooperation for controlled design, development and deployment of AI preserving human safety. The Bletchley Declaration raises concerns about
AI's use in terrorism, criminal activities, and warfare.The report drafting committee was headed by Prof. Yoshua Bengio of Université de
Montréal/Qubec AI institute MILA. The committee had representations from 30 countries including US, 
China, EU and OECD nations, India, UK, Australia, and a few African nations. Though China is represented, the absence of Russia and 
poor symbolic reprentation from Middle East nations is a bit baffling. 

Two recent events suggests perhaps the report came a bit too early which may have not taken full potentials of unleasing capabilities of 
AI into safety consideration.
- The first one is announcement of [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf) from a Chinese company
- Donald Trump announced a massive funding of 500 billion USD for AI Research and Product develements. 

DeepSeek adopts multiheaded Latent Attention using Mixture of Experts with 671B parameters of 37B activated tokens. In pre-training 
phase it uses 14.8 trillion diverse high quality tokens followed by supervised fine-tunning and learning stages. In post-training stage
it distills the knowlegde by chain of thoughts (CoT) by innovative  reasoning based distilled AI model models. 
watched by the internation AI experts after Donald Trump
announced 500 billion USD funding for AI initiative in whitehous in presence of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Softbank CEO  Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. Interestingly, Elon Musk was not only excluded from
the AI iniative but did not have any prior knowledge of Trum's announcement.
