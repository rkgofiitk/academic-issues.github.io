[Blog Index](../index.md)

AI action summit released Internation [AI safety Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025) 
in January before Paris AI action Summit. AI safety report is a columination of Bletchley Declaration which called for international 
cooperation for controlled design, development and deployment of AI preserving human safety. The concerns raised were AI's use in terrorism,
criminal activities, and warfare.The report drafting committee was headed by Prof. Yoshua Bengio of Université de Montréal/Qubec AI institute
MILA. The committee had representations from 30 countries including US, 
China, EU and OECD nations, India, UK, Australia, and a few African nations. Though China is represented, no representation from Russia and 
poor symbolic reprentation from Middle East nations is a bit baffling. Besides, it will be interesting to see the change in the US
government stand on AI safety report after Donald Trump announced 500 billion USD funding for AI initiative in whitehous in presence of
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Softbank CEO  Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. Interestingly, Elon Musk was not only excluded from
the AI iniative but did not have any prior knowledge of Trum's announcement.
