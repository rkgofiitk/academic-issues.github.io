# AI Safety Draft Released

[Blog Index](../index.md)

AI action summit released International [AI safety Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025) 
in January before Paris AI action Summit. The report is a columination of Bletchley Declaration which called for international 
cooperation for controlled design, development and deployment of AI preserving human safety. The Bletchley Declaration raises concerns about
AI's use in terrorism, criminal activities, and warfare.The report drafting committee was headed by Prof. Yoshua Bengio of Université de
Montréal/Qubec AI institute MILA. The committee had representations from 30 countries including US, 
China, EU and OECD nations, India, UK, Australia, and a few African nations. Though China is represented, the absence of Russia and 
poor symbolic reprentation from Middle East nations is a bit baffling. 

Two recent events suggests perhaps the report came a bit too early which may have not taken full potentials of unleasing capabilities of 
AI into safety consideration.
- The first one is announcement of [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf) from a Chinese company
- The US president Donald Trump announced a massive funding of 500 billion USD for AI Research and Product develements. 

DeepSeek adopts multi-headed Latent Attention Model (MAL) using Mixture of Experts (MoE) with 671B parameters with 37B activated tokens. 
In pre-training phase it uses 14.8 trillion diverse high quality tokens followed by supervised fine-tunning and reinforced learning stages. 
In post-training phase it distills knowlegde by innovative reasoning on long chain of thoughts (CoT). From deployment angle, the most
important aspects of DeepSeek are:
- Low cost of development
- Low cost of deployment
  
The estimated cost of DeepSeek's development is 500 Million USD as against 340 Billion USD of OpenAI. At low-end, DeepSeek R1 can
locally on a windows, macOS or linux dual chore device with 8GB RAM having 1GB free disk space. It is an effective democratization of
AI use for everyday use. With the power of AI in hand of ordinary person, the scope of use can be as imaginative as one case guess.
Donald Trump announced 500 billion USD funding for AI initiative in whitehous in presence of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Softbank CEO
Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. Interestingly, Elon Musk was not only excluded from the US government supported
AI iniatives though he was one of the six founders of OpenAI. OpenAI is not open anymore. It is a subcriber-based paid service.
With DeepSeek announcement,I guess US government initiative could do much more than perhaps Sam Altman group has initially
planned for. It increases the scope and the levels of deployments of AI products in military and defense establishment million times
more than intially speculated. Lethal capacity of terrorism strike also increases proportionally.
