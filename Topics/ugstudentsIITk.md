# A Senior's Advise to JEE Advance Qualifiers

Today I stumbled upon a question seeking advice on joining as a freshman at IIT Kanpur. The answer was written by someone who graduated from IITK
some years ago. The comments are interesting. It differs quite a bit from the advice from a second-year, pre-final, or final-year student of 
the institute. The response is quite measured and mature. However, the important aspect that struck me is the interest and usability of 
undergraduate education in the country, even from a supposedly elite institution. The responder says that being stuck with a non-interesting 
discipline acted as a spoiler for his dream. He lost interest after 2nd year until the timeline for a branch change. His 1st and 2nd-year
performance was outstanding; he scored 10/10 and 9.6/10 in his first two years. Yet he could not get a branch change due to B grades in a few subjects. IITK
effectively follows a 4-point grading scheme. So, a B grade is equivalent to 8pt on a scale of 10. It is supposed to be a very good
grade, if not excellent. After that, the responder lost interest in the discipline, and his performance went down. After getting a placement
in the pre-final year, he graduated with a low CPI. I am not aware of the placement opportunities in disciplines like ChE or MSP, and MET.
However, many freshers join IITs hoping to get a branch change to a discipline of their liking. Of course, most students develop 
a preference shaped to satisfy the perception of their parents and the neighborhoods of their parents. These societal perceptions generate from 
the following:

- Pay and compensation packages 
- Comfort at workplaces
- Stability in job and career advancement opportunities
- Peer groups and networking

Except for Computer Science and Engineering, many graduates seek jobs outside the core disciplines. It leads to a situation where almost
all except a few JEE-advance qualifiers aspire to get admission into CSE. Naturally, the closing ranks of CSE at older IITs are very high. Branch
change from other disciplines to CSE is also difficult. We saw the situation unfolding in the last 20 or 25 years. One of my 
colleagues was a proponent of the idea that engineering education at IITs should be market sensitive. His arguments were compelling. 

- IITs should pay higher differential pays to the faculty according to the importance of the discipline to attract the best talents.
- IITs should increase student intake in the disciplines that offer better opportunities to their graduates. 
- IITs should cap student intake and gradually shut the disciplines having shrinking market opportunities.  
- HSS should only be considered as a service department.

The basic premise of his argument is "market must rule." Whether or not we subscribe to his views, it is strengthened by the general 
perception and technology trend. Industry 5.0, driverless cars, drone delivery systems, and Open AI systems combine to create a situation
where opportunities in conventional core technologies are shrinking. Only outstanding experts would still be relevant. Therefore, graduating with 
a B. Tech in CE, ChE, MeT, EE, and ME becomes useless. Pursuing an undergraduate education in engineering other than computer science and engineering 
becomes irrelevant to students. So, engineering education should go for a course correction. National education policy does 
talk about a flexible scheme. How far these flexibilities in the course curriculum could be implemented is still to be seen. We must think
out of the box, even when some disciplines die out. 

The reader may think I lost focus on the initial question of a fresher seeking advice to join IITK. Let me come back to the responder's 
answer in this context. He further expands his answer to say that immediate seniors are not entirely focused, and the "my baap" (seniors know it
all) culture among the peer group could mislead the freshers. The only thing for which the peer group would be helpful is networking. More 
importantly, the responder recognizes the role of professors. He advises the freshers to respect faculty and keep a good relationship with 
the professors without being supercilious. IIT students are good, but 
faculty members have some contributions, even if they may be limited. When choosing a college, the freshers should also evaluate the
institutions based on the primary parameters: infrastructure, peer group, faculty strengths, and faculty outreach.
