# Senior's Advise to Freshers

Today I stumbled upon a query on Quora about joining as a freshman at IIT Kanpur. The answer was written by a person who graduated out of IITK
at least 5 years back. The comments are interesting. It not like the advises you normally get from a second year, prefinal or final year student.
The response seems quite measured and matured. However, the important aspect which struck me is the interest and usability of the undergraduate 
education in the country even from a supposedly elite institution. The responder says that being stuck with a non-interesting discipline wrecked
his interest in B. Tech. He apparently was hoping for a branch change that did not materialized due to strict requirements. His 1st and 2nd year
performances were outstanding, he just got one or two Bs. Yet he could not get a branch change. Subsequently, he lost interest in the discipline
he was stuck. It was down the hill in performance from that point onwards.
