# A Senior's Advise to JEE Advance Qualifiers

Today I stumbled upon a query on Quora about joining as a freshman at IIT Kanpur. The answer was written by a person who graduated out of IITK
some years back. The comments are interesting. It not like the advises you normally get from a second year, pre-final or final year student of 
the institute. The response is quite measured and matured. However, the important aspect that struck me is the interest and usability of the
undergraduate education in the country even from a supposedly elite institution. The responder says that being stuck with a non-interesting 
discipline acted as spoiler. His lost interest after 2nd year until the timeline for a branch change. His performance in 1st and 2nd year
were outstanding, he scored 10/10 and 9.6/10 in first two years. Yet he could not get a branch change. Subsequent to that he lost interest in 
the discipline and he performance went down from that point onwards. After getting a placement in pre-final year he managed to graduate with
a low CPI. I am not aware of the placement opportunities in disciplines like ChE or MSP and MET. However, many freshmen join IITs with a 
hope of getting a branch change to a discipline of their likings. Of course, most of the students develop a liking shaped to satisfy their
perception of their parents and their neighborhoods. These societal perceptions generate from the following:

- Pay packages and compensation
- Comfort in work places
- Stability in job
- Peer groups
- Career advancement

Execept for Computer Science and Engineering, very few graduates will ever opt for a job in core discipline. It leads to a situation where almost all
except a few JEE-advance qualifiers aspire for a admission into CSE. Naturally, closing ranks of CSE at older IITs are very high.
