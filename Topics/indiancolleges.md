# Indian Colleges Affecting Growth of Country's Digital Ecosystem 

Recently, I came across an article titled [Worthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in India."](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/india-s-worthless-college-degrees-undercut-world-s-fastest-growing-major-economy#xj4y7vzkg)  
Over past couple of years,the focus of my blogs was primarily about worthless B. Tech. degrees in computer science. It is flooding illtrained, 
low-skilled programmers; and it is the main reason for pulling back the growth of country's digital ecosystem. The article published in
Bloomborg understandably has a wider audience reach due to the syndicate reporting system. However, it falls short of a root-cause analysis. 
I am sure that authors know where the buck stops. To put it simply all the states and federal regulatory agencies have contributed in ruining 
India's colleges and universities. It allowed unscrupulous politicians and a phony liberal cotrie to exert control over professionals. Of course,
there is group of professionals who colluded with the gang to enjpy power and control. All serious educators and policy planners realize the 
problem but unable do anything other than venting frustrations. It reminds me of the story of three thugs who made the farmer to believe that
he is carrying a dog instead of a goat on his shoulders. Having taught at three different IITs in my long teaching career, I know the problem
and so do my esteemed colleagues. The problem that ails our higher education systems has several layers. Let me start at the bottom of the 
problem stack. 

The primary, middle, and secondary level education in the country largely depends on panchayat and govt run schools. These schools have
a lot of infrastructure-related issues. Some schools are just open schools, many have no building while many others do not have tables or chairs.
However, infrastructure is the least of the problem that beset school education system.  Sometime back I wrote a blog on 5T school upgrade project
of Govt of Odisha.  Capex always yields large and instant kickbacks. So, infrastruture development is most welcome among politicians if there
is an opportunity. I consider that the availability of well-trained teachers is the foundational problem. Schools without provisioning
critical human resources is like raising a building without foundation in an active seismic zone. In an earlier blog, I talked about
a middle school in the Palamau District of Jharkhand. His video report showed a maths teacher did not basics like multiplication tables.
A literature teacher spells all words wrongly. Even the headmaster of the school have no clue how to teach. The responses from teachers 
and students to the reporter's question was appalling. It was a govt funded school. Recently, another video report was circulated among our
colleagues. This video was about a school near Patna in Bihar. Again a govt run school 
where actual teachers were absent and probably engaged in more profitable enterprises. Their places were filled up by proxies ranging from 
husbands to brothers to cousins of the appointed teachers. None of them are qualified for a teacher's position. So, these phony teachers
were acting as proxies. It is not rocket science to understand that the students were learning anything but academics. Though the proxy teachers
are doing a babysitting job, whatever the students learn from interactions is perhaps browbeating. 

Now let us talk about college education. Most colleges in the country are privately affiliated with degree-awarding universities. It is
surprising that these colleges could get affiliations of state universities.  Money and political power prevail more than any academic concerns.
Except for a brief interaction at a Ph.D. admission interview, My knowedge of much humanities sciences is limited. However, in my brief interaction
with the candidates, I found that they were taught a lot of gibberish about the so-called "liberal values."  Sadly, they could not relate their 
knowledge to contemporary practical issues when one probes deeper. Literature students never cared to peek at great Indian classics like 
Ramayana, Mahabharata, or Kalidas's work. Ramayan and Mahabharata are not just Hindu mythology. They give an account of different facets of 
human society, politics, and transactional system in subtle details than a course in wellfare economics can ever teach.
Many students of well-known schools like DU, CU, JU, JNU, UoH try to speak eloquently about English, French classics and Greek mythology, 
but unfortunately could not relate them to Indian epics. I believe they pick up terrible reading habits under the tutelage of so-called guardians
of a syndicate of teachers who operate with poney liberal agenda. Science education is no better. However, the fundamental 
nature of science education is either you know a thing or you do not. These value binaries are absent in HSS. As
a result, one can manage diametrically conflicting abstract views in the grab of freedom of speech and liberal values. On the other hand, if 
you are unsure about a scientific phenomenon, you are done with it. At one point in time, our colleagues in
The physics dept used to say Presidency or JU students were had good scholastic upbringing. However, that is not true anymore. The training at 
these famous institutions is a shadow of what they used to be. Yet JU is still a good university, according to the NIRF ranking, that speaks about 
college education in India. I am not saying all degree-awarding colleges and universities are bad. However, the recruitment of professors has 
been beset with politics. Only a few deserving could get appointments. It is hard to find online recruitment ads for
college/university teachers or find any state PSC is allowed to operate without political interferences. Anecdotally, I remember that an office
staff came to my office with a box of sweets to celebrate his accomplishment
of passing MA economics in second class. I asked him what went wrong and why he could not manage a first class. The reply was revealing. 
He told me, "Sir, I don't have money to pay for a first-class; the rates are pretty high."

AICTE was established in 1945. However, the AICTE Act was passed by the Parliament in 1987. It started dictating terms for establishing  
standardized norms for technical education across the country in the early 1990s. At this critical time, the govt of the day chose the wrong guy
as the Chairperson. As a result, AICTE soon became a cesspool of corruption. I was a member of the evaluation team for new colleges and attended a 
couple of evaluation committee meetings. In one of the meetings, I came across a person who presented seven proposals for promoting colleges spread 
across Tamil Nadu. We rejected all of his proposals, as it became evident that the guy had unscrupulous intentions. His proposals are 
rubbish, and he did not even run a coaching institution and have no resources to establish even a decent school. He thought faculty was an 
expandable commodity. An AICTE stamp of approval is enough to run a racket of distributing certificates. On another occasion, I was an expert 
member of a field inspection team. We visited six colleges seeking AICTE approval for starting B. Tech in CS in the twin city of Secunderabad and 
Hyderabad. Our team had three academic experts and was led by the director of AICTE. The inspection visits of expert teams were supposed to be 
confidential. But the operators knew them in advance. During the inspection team's visit, the proposers tried their
best to bribe the inspection team in various devious means, including presenting gifts for spouses. We rejected all the proposals during 
our inspection, as they needed adequate infrastructure to start a B. Tech CS program. Most of them hired desktops from known 
vendors for inspection to pass off smoothly. Many phony teachers were presented to act as teachers for the inspection day. After that, I stopped
being a part of any AICTE expert team. One of the proposers for a technical college told me outside the meeting that the rejection does not
mean anything. It is just a temporary delay in their project timeline and at times it works fine in assessing key functionaries of
AICTE. Another panel would subsequently accept the proposal after a gap of a few months. 

I am told there are well-known universities and technical colleges in India where you can get an assured degree without seriously taking 
the exams. Every grade has a price. You get the grade you pay for. The photocopy shops in the neighborhood of colleges have operators who could 
give you a copy of exam papers if the right price is paid. Some of these I learned from my connections. I don't have any first-hand knowledge to back
the allegations. However, there cannot be any smoke without a fire. There are about 4000 institutions that offer B. Tech CS degrees. If, on
average, a college produces 40 graduates annually, then India produces about 160000 CS graduates annually. However, between 5-8% of these graduates
are employable. The rest, 92-95% of these unfortunate graduates, are not fit for desk work in government offices. It has severely affected India's
progress in acquiring digital supremacy. Most programmers are cut-paste variety of useless human resource. As a result, the govt portals are 
terrible to use. Large-scale scams have compounded the problems for the citizens. One comes across full-page ads saying that the Aadhar system of
transforming India's socio-economically poor rural population. It prevents leaks, and govt's benefits are reaching directly to citizens. However, if
anyone has tried to download e-aadhar would know how painful it is. The GET requests timeout too often. POST requests cannot get through. 
So, citizens must join the queues at the Post offices for offline enrolments. Offline servers time out often to increase the load. It
is a sheer waste of man-hours that could have been channelized for more productive work. The reader may refer to my last blog on [Aadhar 
Ecosystem and Citizens' Ordeals](./AadharUpdate.md) for furthre details.  

The readers may think I need to suggest remedies before pointing out problems. However, it is straightforward to understand that we need to work from the 
bottom of the pyramid. The rote learning system must be replaced by a system that challenges the mental faculty of students. The teaching profession must 
be rewarding. Unscrupulous private players should be banned. We have AICTE and UGC, but they act differently than SEBI or RBI regulating the education 
system. An educational audit system needs to be established. However, a system will only work if we have enough good people managing them. Lobbying for a 
position must stop. Earlier, I discussed an elaborate process of [selecting heads of higher educational institutions](./universityChiefExecutive.md).
