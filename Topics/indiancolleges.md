# Degrees from Indian Colleges

Recently, I came across an [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/india-s-worthless-college-degrees-undercut-world-s-fastest-growing-major-economy#xj4y7vzkg) 
titled "Worthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in India." A fact that I have been writing about in my blogs. The author of the
article have larger reach for audience as authors of a syndicate reporting system. Having taught at three different IITs in my long teach career spanning
over 35 years, I am well aware of the problem so do my colleagues. The problem that ail our higher education system are manifold. Let me start at
the bottom of the pyramid. 

Primary, middle and secondary school education system in India is largely dependent on panchayat-run schools or govt-run schools. These schools have
lot of infrastructure related issues. However, among these the availability of well trained teachers is the foudational problem. It is like raising 
a building without foundation in an highly active siesmic zone. In an earlier blog, I mentioned about a school in Palamau District of Jharkhand where
a reporter described about maths teacher. The response from teachers and students to the reporter's question were appaling. It was a govt funded
school. Recently, another video report was circulated among our colleagues. This video was made on a school from Bihar. Again a govet run school, 
where actual teachers were absent and probably engaged in a more profitable ventures. Their places were taken up by proxies ranging from 
husbands to brothers to cousins. None of them are qualified to become teacher so were acting as proxies. It is not a rocket science to understand
that the students were not learning anything. The proxy teachers are doing babysitting job. 

Now let us talk about college education. Most of the colleges in the country are private run affiliated to degree awarding universities. Sometimes
I wonder how these colleges could get affiliations. Money and political power prevail more than any academic concerns. Except for a brief interaction at
a Ph. D. admission interview, I did not much about humanities sciences. However, my brief interaction with the candidates, I found that they were 
taught lot of gebrish about the so called "liberal values."  Sadly, they were unable related their knowledge to the practical issues when we 
probed deeper. Students of literature never cared to take a peek at great Indian classics like Ramayana, Mahabharata or Kalidas's work. However, 
some were trying to speak eloquently about world literature. I believe it is just bad reading habit which they picked up. Science education is not
any better. The problem with science education is either you know a thing or you did not. There less binaries in HSS, so one can managed with a
bit of abstract view. However, if you are unsure about a scientific phenomenon then you are done with it. At one point of time, our colleagues in
Physics dept used to say Presidency or JU students are good. However, that is not the case anymore. The training at these famous institutions are 
just shadow of what they used to be. Yet JU is still a good university according to NIRF ranking, that speaks about college education in India. I am
not saying all degree awarding colleges and universities are bad. However, the recruitment of professors have been beset with politics. Only few
deserving could get appointments. Honestly, it is hard to find recruitment ads over the Internet for college/university teachers. I still
remember that an office staff came to my office and offered me a sweet saying that he passed MA examination in second class. I asked him what
went wrong, why he could not manage a first class. The reply was revealing. He told me, "sir I did not have enough money for a first class."

In 1990s AICTE started dictating terms for establishing a set of standardized norms for technical education. Howevr, govt of the day chose a wrong
guy as the Chairperson. As a result AICTE became a cesspool of corruption. I was a member of the evaluation team for new colleges and attended 
a few meetings of the evaluation committee. In one of the meeting I came across a person who presented proposals for seven different colleges
spread of the state of Tamil Nadu. We rejected all of his proposals, as it became evident that the guy was trying to drive benefits out of govt's
efforts to open up technical education to private players. Once, I went for field inspection of six colleges seeking AICTE approval for starting
B. Tech in CS. The inspection visits of expert teams were supposed to be confidential. But the operators knew them in advance. I was approached by
one college through an intermediary about our scheduled visit at least one week in advance. I was stunned to hear him. I knew that informing 
it to AICTE would not make a difference. Rather I may land myself in trouble. During the visit of inspection team, the proposers tried their
best to bribe the inspection team in various devious means including presenting gifts for spouses. We rejected all the proposals during 
our inspection, as they did not have adequate infrastructure to start a B. Tech programme. Most of them hired desktops from known 
vendors for inspection to passoff. Many phoney teacheres were presented to act as teachers for the inspection day. After that I stopped going
to AICTE for exper evaluation. In fact, one of the proposers for a technical college told me outside the meeting that he would have his 
proposal sanctioned by a different committee within next few months. For him it was just a temporary setback. 

I am told that there are shady universities and technical colleges in eastern India where you can get an assured degree without having to seriously 
ake an exam. Every grade has a price. You get the grade you pay for. The photocopy shops in the college neighbourhood have operators who could 
fetch you a copy of exam papers if a right price is paid. Some of these I learned from my connection, I have no first hand knoweldge to back
the allegations. However, there cannot be smoke without fire.
