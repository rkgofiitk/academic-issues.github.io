# Degrees from Indian Colleges Affecting Growth of India's Digital Ecosystem 

Recently, I came across an article titled [Worthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in India."](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/india-s-worthless-college-degrees-undercut-world-s-fastest-growing-major-economy#xj4y7vzkg)  
I have been writing about it in my blogs, especially in the context of untrained cut/paste programmers. All serious educators and policy
planners do realize the problem. The
article understandably has a more extensive audience reach due to a syndicate reporting system. Having taught at three different IITs in my long teaching career 
of over 35 years, I know the problem and my esteemed colleagues well. The problem is that all our higher education systems are manifold. Let me start at
the bottom of the pyramid. 

India's primary, middle, and secondary education system largely depends on panchayat and govt run schools. These schools have
a lot of infrastructure-related issues. However, among these, the availability of well-trained teachers is the foundational problem. Handling building and development of human resources is like raising 
a building without foundation in an active seismic zone. In an earlier blog, I mentioned a school in the Palamau District of Jharkhand, where
a reporter described a maths teacher. The response from teachers and students to the reporter's question was appalling. It was a govt funded
school. Recently, another video report was circulated among our colleagues. This video was about a school in Bihar. Again a govt run school 
where actual teachers were absent and probably engaged in more profitable enterprises. Their places were filled up by proxies ranging from 
husbands to brothers to cousins of the appointed teachers. None of them are qualified for a teacher's position. So, these phony teachers
were acting as proxies. It is not rocket science to understand that the students were learning anything but academics. Though the proxy teachers
are doing a babysitting job, whatever the students learn from interactions is perhaps browbeating. 

Now let us talk about college education. Most colleges in the country are privately affiliated with degree-awarding universities. Sometimes
How could these colleges get affiliations? Money and political power prevail more than any academic concerns. Except for a brief interaction at
a Ph.D. admission interview, I did not know much about humanities sciences. However, in my brief interaction with the candidates, I found that they were 
taught a lot of gibberish about the so-called "liberal values."  Sadly, they could not relate their knowledge to practical issues when one
probes deeper. Literature students never cared to peek at great Indian classics like Ramayana, Mahabharata, or Kalidas's work. However, 
many students I came across try to speak eloquently about world literature. I believe they pick up terrible reading habits under the tutelage of so-called
guardians of a syndicate of teachers who operate with poney liberal agenda. Science education is the same. However, the fundamental nature of science education is either you know a thing or you do not. These value binaries are absent in HSS. As
a result, one can manage diametrically conflicting abstract views in the grab of freedom of speech. On the other hand, if you are unsure
about a scientific phenomenon, you are done with it. At one point in time, our colleagues in
The physics dept used to say Presidency or JU students were good and had scholastic upbringing. However, that is not true anymore. The training at 
these famous institutions is a shadow of what they used to be. Yet JU is still a good university, according to the NIRF ranking, that speaks about 
college education in India. I am not saying all degree-awarding colleges and universities are bad. However, the recruitment of professors has 
been beset with politics. Only a few deserving could get appointments. It is hard to find online recruitment ads for
college/university teachers. Anecdotally, I remember that an office staff came to my office with a box of sweets to celebrate his accomplishment
of passing MA economics in second class. I asked him what went wrong and why he could not manage a first class. The reply was revealing. 
He told me, "Sir, I could pay for a first-class; the rates are pretty high."

AICTE was established in 1945. However, the AICTE Act was passed by the Parliament in 1987. It started dictating terms for establishing  
standardized norms for technical education across the country in the early 1990s.  At this critical time, the govt of the day chose the wrong guy
as the Chairperson. As a result, AICTE soon became a cesspool of corruption. I was a member of the evaluation team for new colleges and attended a 
couple of evaluation committee meetings. In one of the meetings, I came across a person who presented seven proposals for promoting colleges spread 
across Tamil Nadu. We rejected all of his proposals, as it became evident that the guy has unscrupulous intentions. His proposals are 
inadequate, he had no clue of running even a coaching institutions. He thought faculty is an expandable commodity. An AICTE stamp of approval 
is just enough for running racket of distributing certificates. On another occassion, I was an expert member of a field inspection team. We 
visited of six colleges in Secunderabad and Hyderabad, seeking AICTE approval for starting B. Tech in CS. Our team had three academic experts 
and was led by the director of AICTE. The inspection visits of expert teams were supposed to be confidential. But the operators knew them in 
advance. During the inspection team's visit, the proposers tried their
best to bribe the inspection team in various devious ways, including presenting gifts for spouses. We rejected all the proposals during 
our inspection, as they needed adequate infrastructure to start a B. Tech CS program. Most of them hired desktops from known 
vendors for inspection to pass off smoothly. Many phony teachers were presented to act as teachers for the inspection day. After that, I stopped going
to AICTE for expert evaluation. One of the proposers for a technical college told me outside the meeting that the rejection does not
mean anything. It is just a temporary delay in their timeline and works out fine. Another panel subsequently accepted the proposal after
a gap of a few months. 

I am told there are shady universities and technical colleges in eastern India where you can get an assured degree without seriously taking the exams. 
Every grade has a price. You get the grade you pay for. The photocopy shops in the college neighborhood have operators who could 
fetch you a copy of exam papers if the right price is paid. Some of these I learned from my connections. I don't have no first-hand knowledge to back
the allegations. However, there cannot be smoke without fire. There are about 4000 institutions that offer B. Tech CS degrees. If in an
average a college produces 40 graduates annually, then India produces about 160000 CS graduates annually. However, between 5-8% of these graduate
are employable. The rest 92-95% of these unfortunate graduates are not even fit for desk work in govt offices. It has severely affected India's
progress in acquiring digital supremacy. Most programmers are cut-paste kind of useless human resource. As a result the govt portals are 
terrible to use. Large scale scams have compounded the problems for the citizens. One comes across full page ads saying that Aadhar system of
transforming India's socio economically poor rural population. It is preventing leaks and benefits reaching directly to citizens. However, if
anyone has tried to download e-aadhar would know how painful it is. The get requests timeout too often. Post requests cannot get through. 
So, citizens have to join the queues at the Post offices for offline enrolements. Offline servers also timeout often to increase the load. It
is a shere wastage of man hours which could have been channelized for more productive work. The reader may refer to my last blog on [Aadhar 
Enrolement Ordeals](./AadharUpdate.md).
