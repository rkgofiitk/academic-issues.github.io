# Transformative Impacts of AGI in CS Part II

Continuing from the previous post on [transformative impacts of AGI](./Software_engineering_jobs.md), I wish to explore a bit on 
suggested modification of undergraduate syllabus in computer science and engineering. Many institutions are already offering UG
programme in three different specializations in computer science and engineering, 
- AI/ML
- Data science
- Fintech

Of course Fintech has not yet stablized as much a specialization as AI/ML or Data Science. The main focus of Fintech is to 
train students in management and forecasting of investment banking, finace, insurance and stock market. A Fintech trained 
professional is also expected to have some fundamental knowledge of following technology and related tools:
- Cloud computing
- Blockchain, smart agreements, and related algorithms
- Internet of things for monitoring, data gathering, and mining
- Smart logistics and robotics
- AI for detection and forecasting
Apart from general understanding of technology, Fintech specialists have a big role in risk managment, compliance of financial
ethics and governance, cyber security, detection of frauds, and digital payment systems. Fintech courses are offered by IIMs
and other management schools like ISB in India. BIT Pilani and a few IITs like IIT Kanpur, IIT Jodhpur also offer fintech courses.
Older IITs like IIT Kharagpur and Kanpur have Industrial Management Departments which typically handle courses in management
and Finance. The target audience for most Fintech courses are working professionals. Therefore, Fintech courses are offered
either in online or intensive offline short certification modes. I think most institutions are watching to understand the
if Fintech could emerge as a discipline with specialized requirements. 

Data science specialists are trained to handle volumes of data that far exceed the capacity of any large data base. The collection
of world-wide data is estimated to be around [149 ZB in 2024](https://rivery.io/blog/big-data-statistics-how-much-data-is-there-in-the-world/).
A zeta byte (ZB) is $10^{21}$ bytes that can fully populate 250 million DVDs. Handling of Big data requires training in 
Datamining, Statistical methods, Data visualization, Machine Learning AI techniques. Conventional techniques like indexing 
won't work. IIT Madras offers Masters program in Data Sceince. IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT 
Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee offer different Data Science and AI/ML courses. These courses include AI/ML, Computer Vision, LLM, 
Deep Learning, Financial Forensic, Business Analytics and familiarization in Industry relevant software tools like full stack 
python develepment framework for handling and visualization of data. 

All top institutions in India are already offering AI/ML courses. IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Guwahati are offering 
Bachelors' degree program in AI/ML. IIT Kanpur is offering M.Tech programme in AI/M while IIT Bombay offers a minor in AI/ML 
at UG levelL Most IITs offer AI/ML specialization to computer science and engineering B. Techs. Dr. Kshitiz Verma runs a
[peronal Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vkshitiz) for his class lectures in AI and LLM. Dr. Verma is a faculty 
member of IT and Communication Department at JKLU,Jaipur. He was one of our students at IIT Kanpur. Dr. Verma also has a 
law degree in IPR. A RAG kind of tool on IPR related laws could be a game changer in legal profession.But I am not sure if
Indian Legal Professionals are still ready for the use of AI powered tools.
