# Transformative Impacts of AGI in CS Part II

Continuing from the previous post on [transformative impacts of AGI](./Software_engineering_jobs.md), I wish to explore a bit on 
suggested modification of undergraduate syllabus in computer science and engineering. Many institutions are already offering UG
programme in three different specializations in computer science and engineering, 
- AI/ML
- Data science
- Fintech

Of course Fintech has yet to stablize as a specialization like AI/ML or Data Science. The main focus of Fintech is to 
train students in management and forecasting of investment banking, finace, insurance and stock market. A Fintech trained 
professional is also expected to have some fundamental knowledge of following technology and related tools:
- Cloud computing
- Blockchain, smart agreements, and related algorithms
- Internet of things for monitoring, data gathering, and mining
- Smart logistics and robotics
- AI for detection and forecasting
Apart from general understanding of technology, Fintech specialists need to advise investors in risk managment, compliance of
financial ethics and governance, cyber security, detection of frauds, and digital payment systems. Fintech courses are offered by IIMs
and other management schools like ISB in India. BIT Pilani and a few IITs like IIT Kanpur, IIT Jodhpur also offer fintech courses.
Older IITs like IIT Kharagpur and Kanpur have Industrial Management Departments which typically handle courses in management
and Finance. The target audience for most Fintech courses are working or experienced professionals. Therefore, Fintech courses
are offered either in online or intensive offline short certification modes. I think most institutions are watching to understand the
if Fintech could emerge as a discipline with specialized requirements. 

Data science specialists are trained to handle volumes of data that far exceed the capacity of any large data base. The collection
of world-wide data is estimated to be around [149 ZB in 2024](https://rivery.io/blog/big-data-statistics-how-much-data-is-there-in-the-world/).
A zeta byte (ZB) is $10^{21}$ bytes that can fully populate 250 million DVDs. Handling of Big data requires training in 
Datamining, Statistical methods, Data visualization, Machine Learning AI techniques. Conventional techniques like indexing 
won't work. IIT Madras offers Masters program in Data Sceince. IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT 
Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee offer different Data Science and AI/ML courses. These courses include AI/ML, Computer Vision, LLM, 
Deep Learning, Financial Forensic, Business Analytics and familiarization in Industry relevant software tools like full stack 
python develepment framework for handling and visualization of data. 

All top institutions in India have already started offering AI/ML courses. IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Guwahati are offering 
Bachelors' degree program in AI/ML. IIT Kanpur is offering M.Tech programme in AI/M while IIT Bombay offers CS minor in AI/ML 
at UG levelL Most IITs offer AI/ML specialization to computer science and engineering B. Techs. Dr. Kshitiz Verma runs a
[peronal Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vkshitiz) for his class lectures in AI and LLM. Dr. Verma is a faculty 
member of IT and Communication Department at JKLU,Jaipur. JKLU is a private university funded and run by JK group. Dr Verma
was one of our students at IIT Kanpur. He also has a law degree in IPR. A RAG kind of tool on IPR related laws could be a game
changer in legal profession.But I am not sure if Indian Legal Professionals are still ready for the use of AI powered tools.   

The September 2024 issue of CACM carries an article by Esther Shein on "(Impacts of AI in Computer Science Education)[https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3673428]." 
Shein declares that "you still need the founcation to be effective computer sceintists or software engineers." The paper 
tells about an experiment conducted by [Eric Klopfer](https://education.mit.edu/person/eric_klopfer/) with Under Graduate
students in Computer Science at MIT. He divided the class into three groups. The students did not know about FORTRAN. I guess
that is true of current generation of students in CS in India too. Eric Klopfer asked the students to solve a programming task in 
FORTRAN. He allowed one group of students to use ChatGPT and the other group to use Metaâ€™s Code Llama large language model (LLM),
and the remaining group to use only Google search engine. The first group was quickest to solve the problem, the second group 
took more time, and the third group took the longest time. The second part of Klopfer's experiment was to test the students for
solving the same task from memnory. The first group which used chatGPT, remembered nothing at all and failed. Half the students
of the second group passed the tests and every students of the third group passed the test. The experiment estblishes the fact
that if you need a one time programming task, ChatGPT or any GenAI tool is the best route to accomplish the same. There is
nothing very startling about the findings. Unless one really goes deeper into a problem the knowledge retention is understandably
low.

Except for the purpose of submitting a home assignment, using ChatGPT won't fetch a job as most programming task require 
regular maintenance to cater for changing customer requirements. One may wonder "Is there a role for GenAI tools in teaching 
beyond solving home assignments?" The tool could make the teaching suddenly more alive than it is now. For example, ChatGPT
may be suited best for tutoring students. I see the tool as creating much more amplified but similar disruption in teaching
when calculators were introduced. Job of calculations were eliminiated, but teaching methods evolved to take care of the
disruption. Similarly, the best use of Generative AI tool would be to use it for learn programming skills, fundamentals 
of data structure and so on, clarify doubts, etc. I am suggesting the adaptation of ChatGPT as a Retrieval Augmented 
Generation (RAG) tool for virtual teaching assistants. However, we should be aware of the downside of the suggestion. It may
perhaps encourage  cuts in university funding for teaching assistants that in turn could severly affect the research and 
developement. 

We can summarize major concentration threads in UG programmes in computer science and engineering as follows:
- Deep learning/Neural Network
- Datamining/Graphmining
- Large Language Model/Genereative AI 
- Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistic
- Statistical Learning and Inferences/Automated Reasoning

One of the toughest course in computer science is ompiler design. NLP can enhance compiler design particularly in source code 
analysis and understanding the intent of codes.Similarly NLP can be used in code generation.While NLP cannot entirely replace
aspects of traditional compiler design course, it will be possible reduce load with respect to compiler design as capabilities
of NLP improves. Database, Datamining and Graphmining are all necessary for acquiring expertise AI/ML. Query handling in AI,
clustering results and finding patterns in results all depend on data.
