Continuing from the previous post on [transformative impacts of AGI](./Software_engineering_jobs.md), the current post explores
a bit on modifications of the computer science and engineering undergraduate syllabus integrating AI-ML concentration. 
Many institutions are offering UG programs in three relatively new specializations in computer science and engineering, 
- AI-ML
- Data Science
- Fintech

Of course, Fintech has yet to stabilize as a specialization like AI/ML or Data Science. The main focus of Fintech is to 
train students in management and forecasting of investment banking, finance, insurance, and stock markets. So, Fintech is 
not a stream of computer science and engineering. However, a Fintech-trained professional is expected to have some 
fundamental knowledge of the following technology and related tools:
- Cloud computing
- Blockchain, smart agreements, and related algorithms
- Internet of Things for monitoring, data gathering, and mining
- Smart logistics and robotics
- AI for detection and forecasting
  
Apart from a general understanding of technology, Fintech specialists must advise investors in risk management, compliance with
financial ethics and governance, cyber security, detection of fraud, and digital payment systems. Therefore, the area has to
be upgraded to accommodate contemporary software tools. In India, IIMs and other management schools like ISB offer Fintech 
courses. BIT Pilani and a few IITs like IIT Kanpur and IIT Jodhpur also offer Fintech courses. Older IITs like IIT Kharagpur
and Kanpur have industrial management departments that typically run management and finance courses. The target audience
for most Fintech courses are working or experienced professionals. Therefore, Fintech courses are offered online 
or intensive offline short certification mode. Most institutions are watching to understand if Fintech could emerge as a
discipline with specialized requirements. 

Data Science specialists are trained to handle volumes of data that far exceed the capacity of any large database. The collection
Worldwide data is estimated at around [149 ZB in 2024](https://rivery.io/blog/big-data-statistics-how-much-data-is-there-in-the-world/).
A zeta byte (ZB) is $10^{21}$ bytes that can fully populate 250 million DVDs. Handling Big data requires training in 
Datamining, Statistical methods, Data visualization, Machine Learning AI techniques. Conventional techniques like indexing 
won't work. IIT Madras offers a Masters program in Data Science. IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT 
Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee offers different Data Science and AI/ML courses. These courses include AI/ML, Computer Vision, LLM, 
Deep Learning, Financial Forensics, Business Analytics, and familiarization with relevant software tools like full-stack 
Python development framework for extraction, summarization, and visualization of data. Therefore, Data Science has become an
integrated accessory for Fintech companies for development of digital products.

All top institutions in India have already started offering AI/ML courses. IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Guwahati are offering 
Bachelor's degree program in AI/ML. IIT Kanpur offers an M.Tech program in AI/M, while IIT Bombay offers a CS minor in AI/ML 
at the UG level. Most IITs offer AI/ML specialization in computer science and engineering. B. Techs. Dr. Kshitiz Verma runs a
[personal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vkshitiz) for his class lectures in AI and LLM. Dr. Verma is a faculty 
member of the IT and Communication Department at JKLU, Jaipur. JKLU is a private university funded and run by the JK group. Dr Verma
was one of our students at IIT Kanpur. He also has a law degree in IPR. A RAG tool on IPR-related laws could be a game
changer in the legal profession. However, I am unsure if Indian courts are ready yet to accept the assistance of AI-powered tools 
in resolving legal disputes.   

The September 2024 issue of CACM carries an article by Esther Shein on "[Impacts of AI in Computer Science Education](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3673428)." 
Shein declares, "You still need the foundation to be effective computer scientists or software engineers." The paper 
tells about an experiment conducted by [Eric Klopfer](https://education.mit.edu/person/eric_klopfer/) with undergraduate
students in Computer Science at MIT. He divided the class into three groups. The students did not know about FORTRAN.
Eric Klopfer asked the students to solve a programming task in 
FORTRAN. He allowed one group of students to use ChatGPT, the other group to use Meta's Code Llama large language model (LLM),
and the remaining group to use only the Google search engine. The first group solved the problem quickly, the second group 
took more time, and the third group took the longest time. The second part of Klopfer's experiment tested the student's ability to
solve the same task from memory. The first group that used chatGPT remembered nothing at all and failed. Half the students
in the second group passed the tests, and every student in the third group passed the test. The experiment establishes 
that ChatGPT or any GenAI tool is the best route if you need a one-time programming task. There is
nothing very startling about the findings. Knowledge retention is understandably low unless one goes deeper into a problem.

ChatGPT won't fetch a job except for submitting a home assignment, as most programming tasks require 
regular maintenance to cater to changing customer requirements. Without extensive documentation, engineers find software 
maintenance always challenging. Reprogramming is often easier than patching software that one has not been part of
the development team. So, in the real world, one wonders, "Is there a role for a GenAI tool in teaching beyond solving home 
assignments?" However, the tool could make the teaching suddenly more alive than it is now. For example, ChatGPT
may be best suited for tutoring students. The tool has created much more amplified but similar disruption in teaching
when calculators were introduced. It eliminated the steps for manual calculations, but teaching methods evolved to address the
disruption. Similarly, the best use of a Generative AI tool would be to learn programming skills, data structure fundamentals, 
clarify doubts, etc. Adapt ChatGPT as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tool for [virtual teaching assistants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvXZCocyU_M&pp=ygUTY2hhdGdwdCBpbiB0dXRvcmluZw%3D%3D). However, we 
should be aware of the downside of the suggestion. It may encourage cuts in university funding for teaching assistants, which 
could severely affect research and development. 

We can summarize major concentration threads in UG programs in computer science and engineering as follows:
- Deep learning/Neural Network
- Data mining/Graph mining
- Large Language Model/Generative AI 
- Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistic
- Statistical Learning and Inferences/Automated Reasoning

One of the most challenging courses in computer science is compiler design. NLP can enhance compiler design, particularly in 
source code analysis, understanding the code intent, and code generation. While NLP cannot entirely replace
aspects of a traditional compiler design course, it will likely reduce the load of a compiler design course as the capabilities
of NLP improve. Database, data mining, and graph mining are necessary for acquiring expertise in AI/ML. They help in extracting
meaningful patterns from large datasets. Machine learning algorithms are trained to make predictions based on these patterns.
A crucial part of Generative AI is query handling, clustering results, and finding patterns in the intermediate results to draw 
inferences. Everything has to do with data. Therefore, learning database techniques is essential for AI/ML. Statistical learning
is critical in computer vision, speech recognition, and bioinformatics. 

Now, let us understand how the AI/ML concentration can be integrated into a B. Tech CS curriculum. Before continuing further,
let me add a disclaimer. I do not intend to propose a complete structure for the B. Tech curriculum. I will leave it to
stakeholders and experts in AI/ML. My focus is only to emphasize that integrating AI/ML concentration into a B. Tech CS 
syllabus is possible while retaining the core intact. It also leaves enough room for adding other specializations like
distributed system/advanced OS, Computer Architecture, Cryptography, Cyber security, HPC, Software architecture, etc. 
Typically, the duration of one semester is 15 weeks, consisting of roughly 450 contact hours (@ 6 hours per day, i.e., 
@30 hours a week). Therefore, each semester's credit requirement is 30 (assuming one credit unit is equivalent to 15 contact
hours). So, a  student would log in between 150-165 credit units for a UG degree in a discipline that is equivalent to
roughly in the neighborhood of 30-35 courses, including projects/practicals. Typically, B. Tech core in CS consists of eight 
to nine courses. It includes 
- Fundamentals Programming,
- Computer Organization,
- Data Structures, Algorithms,
- Theory of Computation,
-  Operating Systems,
- Computer Networks,
- Databases.

Some schools use course bucketing to allow students to choose one or two from a bucket. For example, OS, Computer Networks,
The database may belong to one bucket. Similarly, another bucket may include Compiler Design, Software Engineering, and PoPL. 
The idea is to limit the core credits to 32-35 units and ensure students can fulfill their interest in them. That
leaves at least 120 credit units for integrating AI/ML concentration into B. Tech CS curriculum. Therefore, the five AI/ML
topics mentioned can be easily covered.
