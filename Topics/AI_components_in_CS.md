# Transformative Impacts of AGI in CS Part II

Continuing from the previous post on [transformative impacts of AGI](./Software_engineering_jobs.md), let us explore a bit on 
suggested modification of undergraduate syllabus in computer science and engineering. Many institutions are already offering UG
programme in three different specialization in computer science and engineering, 
- AI/ML
- Data science
- Fintech

The main focus of Fintech is to train students in management and forecasting of investment banking, finace, insurance and stock
market. A Fintech trained professional is expected to have sound knowledge of fundamentals of following technology:
- Cloud computing
- Blockchain, smart agreements, and related algorithms
- Internet of things for monitoring and data gathering
- Smart logistics and robotics
- AI for detection and forecasting
Apart from general understanding of technology, Fintech specialists have a big role in risk managment, compliance of financial
ethics and governance, cyber security, detection of frauds, and digital payment systems. Fintech courses are offered by IIMs
and other management schools like ISB in India. BIT Pilani and a few IITs like IIT Kanpur, IIT Jodhpur also offer fintech courses.
IIT Kanpur's course is offered by its Industrial Management Department. Most Fintech courses are targeted
for working professionals in online certification mode. I think most institutions are watching to understand the evolution of
Fintech as a discipline with specialized requirements. 

Data science specialists are trained to handle volume of data that far exceeds the capacity of a large data base. The collection
of world-wide data is estimated to be around 149 ZB in 2024. A zeta byte (ZB) is $10^{21}$ bytes that can fully populate 250
million DVDs. Handling of Big data requires training in Datamining, Statistical methods, Data visualization, Machine Learning
AI techniques. Conventional techniques like indexing won't work. IIT Madras offers Masters program in Data Sceince. IIT Delhi,
IIT Guwahati, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee offer different Data Science and AI/ML courses. These 
courses include AI/ML, Computer Vision, LLM, Deep Learning, Financial Forensic, Business Analytics and familiarization in
Industry relevant software tools like full stack python develepment framework for handling and visualization of data. 

All top institutions in India already offering AI/ML. IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Guwahati are offering Bachelors' degree 
program in AI/ML. IIT Kanpur is offering M.Tech programme in AI/M while IIT Bombay offers a minor in AI/ML at UG levelL Most
IITs offer AI/ML specialization to computer science and engineering B. Techs. Dr. Kshitiz Verma runs a [peronal channel in
Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/vkshitiz) for his class lectures in AI and LLM. Dr. Verma is a faculty member of IT and 
Communication Department at JKLU,Jaipur. He was one of our students at IIT Kanpur.
