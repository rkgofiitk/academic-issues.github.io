# National Test Agency Goofs up NEET 2024

Let us first begin with the creation of NTA. In 1961, IIT Joint Entrance Examination was established
for admissions into IITs. Since then JEE was ranked consistently as one of the world's toughest and
the most secured examination in India. However, it was not without controversies. In 1997, JEE papers
were leaked at a center in Patna (suprvised by IIT Kharagpur). JEE was conducted for the second time
that year. It took a bit of time, because IITs resorted to a bit of saving and did not have a second
set of question paper for an immediate rescheduling of the test. That was the year IITs ended up 
spending more on conduct of JEE than earlier. The lesson learnt is never forgotten. In 2005, The Hindu
started campaigning against supposedly unfair coaching mania amongst parent and students creating
a psychologically, economically cost to society in general. It led to a glasnost in JEE for IITs.
From 2006, IITs started two-tier exam; a prelimiary multiple choice objective test followed by
a subjective test. Those who did not qualify MCO test were eliminated after screening phase. In
May 2012, the then HRD minister Mr. Kapil Sibal wanted to replace IIT JEE by a common test for
all engineering colleges. IITs opposed it pointing out that it is violative of IIT Acts passed
parliament. However, many IIT Directors sided with Mr. Sibal and Senates of IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay
and IIT Delhi were spearheading the confrontation. Mr Sibal went to the extent of saying that 
he would create another IITK(apil) if IITK were to conduct their own admission test. However, a 
compromise was brokered and AIEEE JEE (mains) was created as a replacement for IIT's screening
test. The process has worked without problem as far as IIT admissions are concerned, because
Advanced JEE is still under the control of IITs. Now NTA (National Test Agency) is conducting
JEE(mains) in place of NCERT. NTA was primarily created for conduct of JEE (mains) multiple times
in a year and generate a pool of eligible candidates for JEE (advance). Subsequently, it took
charge of NEET. NEET was sarted in 2013 to replace AIPMT and other state level tests for admissions
into medical colleges. However, it could not be conducted in 2014 and 2015 due to court impasse. 
Indian court procedures are notoriously time wasting tactics to stall all administrative or
people centric welfare measures even prosecution against corrupt politicians. All
controversies around NEET is not over yet. DMK, AIDMK and many other political parties consider
NEET as entrance test to state controlled Medical Colleges is an infringement in federal 
structure of India. However, education is in concurrent list. So central govt has a power to 
enact law related to administration of Education as a service to people. Medical Council of India
is a powerful body of doctors in India. MCI too opposed NEET when CBSE mooted it. That explains 
the reason why NEET is such a controversial entrace examination. So, it is hard to imagine why
NTA goofed NEET 2024 up so badly. I understand 67 examinees scored 719 out of 720 marks and one
center in Haryana alone had six such examinees topping with AIR 1. Already people from Andhra
and Telengana had knocked Supreme court seeking a cancellation of NEET 2024 result. 

According to reports, NTA awarded grace marks to 1500 candidates who complained about wrong
questions. NTA explains that because of grace marks, statistically impossible situations of 
candidate scoring 719 and 718 have arisen. There were reports which also suggest that test papers
were leaked out before the conduct of examination in Patna. Apparently, an FIR lodged with
Sashtri Nagar Police station in Patna. However, I have no independent confirmation to back the
report. Social media is full of personal accounts of candidates who claimed wrong papers were
distributed in a few centers and taken back after they have already started solving the paper
and marking OMRs. Clearly, NTA has not been able to establish a full-proof process for test
and chewed more than it can probably digest. IITs conduct online GATE examination without much
of a problem from 2014. I don't understand why NTA is still having teething problem. I am not
casting any asperstions on NTA chief or its organizational setup without knowing details. But
I believe buck stops at chief's desk. It is high time that govt revamps NTA structure considering
the large stakeholders' base. There should be a through review of NTA's organizational setup 
to localize the goof up. The test process itself should be vetted by experience people with proven
track record of integrity. I think just putting big names is not enough. We need experts who
go into micro-level details of the process of conducting a secure exam rather than award seeking
CV-building individuals. It is not rocket science to discover who or which loop-hole in the
process of conducting examination brought the entire process under cloud. 

The other thing I want to point out is about Patna which many say is the location where test
papers were leaked. It happened also in JEE 1997. Some thinking must be done about location of
test centers or create processes that will ensure sanctity of the test. Unfortunately, people in 
lower the chain to conduct test can be bribed easily. Light punishments against corruption in the
country has emboldened ordinary non-descript even god fearing people to accept bribe as if it
is almost a way of life like religion is.

One retired justice of Madras highcourt reported to have suggested the DMK govt in Tamilnadu to
abolish NEET and take steps to ensure plus two marks be considered for admission. People having no
connection to reality are pushing opinions to muddy the water. First of all, the sanctity of the
school leaving exam is well known. Examiners are constant pressure from influential parents, 
politician friends of candidate to improve and even undermine the evaluation process. There are 
schools where competent teachers are unavailable. State govts are in competitions to close down
govt run schools. Under the situation the school education is essentially a scam where students
with sufficiently influential parent could score above the required threshold. So, advocacy by the
opinion makers seem to invite more problems than solutions. There is no way to replace a leveler
like secured admission test. Whether NTA is a upto the job or not is the point of debate.
