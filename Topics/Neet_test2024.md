# National Test Agency Goofs up NEET 2024

Let us first begin with the creation of NTA. In 1961, IIT Joint Entrance Examination was established
for admissions into IITs. Since then JEE was ranked consistently as one of the world's toughest and
the most secured examination in India. However, it was not without controversies. In 1997, JEE papers
were leaked at a center in Patna (suprvised by IIT Kharagpur). JEE was conducted for the second time
that year. It took a bit of time, because IITs resorted to a bit of saving and did not have a second
set of question paper for an immediate rescheduling of the test. That was the year IITs ended up 
spending more on conduct of JEE than earlier. The lesson learnt is never forgotten. In 2005, The Hindu
started campaigning against supposedly unfair coaching mania amongst parent and students creating
a psychologically, economically cost to society in general. It led to a glasnost in JEE for IITs.
From 2006, IITs started two-tier exam; a prelimiary multiple choice objective test followed by
a subjective test. Those who did not qualify MCO test were eliminated after screening phase. In
May 2012, the then HRD minister Mr. Kapil Sibal wanted to replace IIT JEE by a common test for
all engineering colleges. IITs opposed it pointing out that it is violative of IIT Acts passed
parliament. However, many IIT Directors sided with Mr. Sibal and Senates of IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay
and IIT Delhi were spearheading the confrontation. Mr Sibal went to the extent of saying that 
he would create another IITK(apil) if IITK were to conduct their own admission test. However, a 
compromise was brokered and AIEEE JEE (mains) was created as a replacement for IIT's screening
test. The process has worked without problem as far as IIT admissions are concerned, because
Advanced JEE is still under the control of IITs. Now NTA (National Test Agency) is conducting
JEE(mains) in place of NCRTE.
