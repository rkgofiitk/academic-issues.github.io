# NEET 2024 Fiasco, NTA Goofs-up Big

[Blog index](../index.md)

Let us first begin with the creation of NTA. In 1961, the IITs agreed to hold a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)
for admissions into their UG program. Since then, JEE has been ranked consistently as one of the world's most 
challenging and the most secured examinations in India. However, it was not entirely without controversies.
In 1997, JEE test papers were leaked at a center in Patna (supervised by IIT Kharagpur). JEE was conducted for
the second time that year. It took some time because IITs resorted to a bit of saving and did not have a second
set of question papers to reschedule the test immediately. That was the year IITs ended up spending more than
usual on the conduct of JEE. The lesson learned is always remembered. In 2005, The Hindu
started campaigning against supposedly unfair coaching mania amongst parents and students, creating
a psychological and economic cost to society. It led to a glasnost in JEE for IITs.
In 2006, IITs started a two-tier exam: a preliminary multiple-choice objective test followed by
a subjective test. Those who did not qualify for the MCO test were eliminated after the screening phase. 
In May 2012, the then HRD minister, Mr. Kapil Sibal, wanted to replace IIT JEE with a common test for
all engineering colleges. IITs opposed it, pointing out that it violated the IIT Acts passed
by parliament. However, most IIT Directors sided with Mr. Sibal. The Senates of IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, 
and IIT Delhi were spearheading the confrontation with the HRD minister. Mr Sibal threatened that 
he would create another IITK (euphemistically termed IIT Kapil) if IITK were to conduct its admission test.
However, IIT councils brokered a compromise. AIEEE JEE (mains) was created to replace IIT's screening
test. The process has worked without problems as far as IIT admissions are concerned because
Advanced JEE is still under the control of IITs. CBSE controlled JEE(mains) initially. A few minor
incidents of paper leakage happened during that time. However, CBSE promptly took situations under control
with help from IITs. NTA was created to conduct JEE (mains) multiple times
a year and generate a pool of eligible candidates for JEE (advance). Subsequently, it took
charge of NEET. 

NEET was started in 2013 to replace AIPMT and other state-level medical college admissions tests. 
However, it could not be conducted in 2014 and 2015 due to court impasse. 
Indian court procedures are notoriously time-wasting tactics that stall all administrative or
people-centric welfare measures, as well as prosecutions against corrupt politicians. All
controversies around NEET are not over yet. DMK, AIDMK, and many other political parties oppose NEET as an 
entrance test to state-controlled medical colleges. They want people to believe that NEET infringes on India's federal structure. However, education is on the concurrent list. So, the central govt has the power to 
enact laws related to the administration of education as a service to the people. The Medical Council of India
is a powerful body of doctors. MCI also opposed NEET when CBSE mooted it for fear of losing clout. That explains 
why NEET is such a controversial entrance examination. So, it is hard to imagine why
NTA goofed NEET 2024 so badly. I understand that 67 examinees scored 719 out of 720 marks, and one
center in Haryana alone had six such examinees topping with AIR 1. Already, people from Andhra
and Telangana had knocked the Supreme Court seeking a cancellation of the NEET 2024 result. 

According to reports, NTA awarded grace marks to 1500 candidates who complained about wrong
questions. NTA explains that a statistically impossible situation of 
candidates scoring 719 or 718 has arisen because of grace marks. Some reports also suggest that test papers
were leaked before the examination was conducted in Patna. An FIR was lodged with
Sashtri Nagar Police station in Patna. However, I have no independent confirmation to back the
report. Social media is full of personal accounts of candidates who claimed the invigilators distributed the wrong papers
in a few centers and were taken back after they started solving the paper
and marking OMRs. NTA still needs to establish a foolproof process for conducting tests. It appears to
have chewed more than it can probably digest. IITs have conducted online GATE examinations with little
of a problem since 2014. TCS was given the responsibility of handling nearly 15 lac candidates.
TCS had no prior experience conducting such a nation-wide online examination. However,
IIT's process was very elaborate and had exactly predicted situations that may emerge during a
test. A practical solution to handle each situation is provided to TCS and 
test center invigilators. Therefore, TCS could handle the test even with their company freshers. I'm curious
why NTA is still having teething problems after being in the business of conducting entrance tests for
seven long years. Without first-hand knowledge of details, I cannot cast aspersions on the NTA chief or 
its organizational setup. But the buck stops at the chief's desk. It is high time that the government revamped the NTA 
structure, considering the large stakeholder base it caters to. A thorough review 
of NTA's organizational setup should be conducted to localize the goof-up. Experienced people with a proven
track record of integrity should vet the test process. Just putting big names is not enough. We need experts who
go into micro-level details of conducting a secure exam rather than award-seeking
CV-building individuals. Discovering who or which loophole in conducting an examination may bring the entire 
process under a cloud is not rocket science. 

The other thing I want to point out is the notorious distinction that Patna has acquired as the
location from where test papers were leaked. It happened for JEE in 1997. Some thinking must be
done to carefully choose test centers and create processes to ensure the integrity of tests
across Patna. Of course, I believe Patna is one of many centers where test papers are being
leaked regularly. Other locations across the country may also be involved.  Unfortunately, it is relatively
easy to bribe the invigilators and the presiding officers for the conduct of tests. Light
punishments against corruption in the country have encouraged ordinary, non-descript, even god-fearing
people to accept bribes as if it were almost a way of life, like practicing religious rituals. 

One retired justice of Madras High Court reported to have suggested that the DMK government in Tamilnadu 
abolish NEET and take steps to ensure plus two marks as the basis for admission. People who 
have no connection to reality push opinions to muddy the water. First of all, the sanctity of the
school leaving exam is well known. I know examiners are constantly under pressure from influential
parents with active connivance of corrupt politician friends. Some examiners are bribed, and others
are cajoled or blackmailed to inflate evaluation in favor of specific candidates. Certain state 
governments surreptitiously disseminate instructions through bureaucrats and the respective directorates
of school education to prop up examinees from certain districts in turn. However, if one goes deeper into
the problem, one will see that most schools in those districts do not have competent teachers. So, how do 
the students suddenly perform unexpectedly well in school leaving exams? Following the results of the school
leaving examination diligently, one may see an emerging pattern in social engineering in action at the behest
of political masters in the past decade or so. Many well-known schools in the urban centers do not 
perform well in school leaving examinations. Does it mean that students in urban centers at well-known 
schools have suddenly gone dumb? The state governments appear to compete in closing down 
government-run schools. Under this situation, school education is
a scam where students with sufficiently influential parents could score above the required
threshold. The sleek advocates and influential opinion makers invite more problems than 
solutions. There is no way to replace a leveler like a secured admission test. Whether NTA is up to 
the job or not is the point of debate.
