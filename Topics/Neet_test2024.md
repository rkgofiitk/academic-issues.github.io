# National Test Agency Goofs up NEET 2024

Let us first begin with the creation of NTA. In 1961, IIT Joint Entrance Examination was established
for admissions into IITs. Since then JEE was ranked consistently as one of the world's toughest and
the most secured examination in India. However, it was not without controversies. In 1997, JEE papers
were leaked at a center in Patna (suprvised by IIT Kharagpur). JEE was conducted for the second time
that year. It took a bit of time, because IITs resorted to a bit of saving and did not have a second
set of question paper for an immediate rescheduling of the test. That was the year IITs ended up 
spending more on conduct of JEE than earlier. The lesson learnt is never forgotten. In 2005, The Hindu
started campaigning against supposedly unfair coaching mania amongst parent and students creating
a psychologically, economically cost to society in general. It resulted in glasnost in JEE for IITs.
