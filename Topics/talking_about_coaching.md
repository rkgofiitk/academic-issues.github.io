# Are coaching centers liable for the decline of the country's economy?

[Back to Index](../index.md)

Recently, many UPSC aspirants were trapped in floods in the basement of a building where Rau's IAS Circle library
was located. Three of the aspirants died. After about a week's noise in the media, everything is back to normal.
No one (the Delhi government, Delhi corporation, or the central government) cared.  The current post aims to 
understand the reasons behind societal apathy and the unhinged operations carried out by coaching centers right 
under the noses of various regulators.

Regardless of criticisms by left-leaning activists and liberals, wealth creation is vital to a nation's growth.
If a country's GDP continues to rise then growth is feasible. Growth over the long term cannot be sustained unless 
the manufacturing sector contributes 20% of GDP. The service sector is driving India's economic growth. It makes 
up half of India's GDP. With an estimated value of US$6.5 billion, coaching institutes contribute a mere 0.2% of India's
GDP.  Compared to academic institutions in the US, Japan, UK, China, Singapore, South Korea, or
even Taiwan, Indian institutions do not rank well. There has been no change in the ground despite the new NEP.
Then why is there such a focus on coaching institutions? After all, they prepare aspirants for entrance into
medical sciences, engineering, management, and law schools. Only at most 2% of the aspirants get admission into a
few elite schools in India. These include IITs, NIITs, IIMs, AIMS, IISER, BITS Pilani, National law colleges,
and a few other CFTIs. India has just about 150-200 elite institutions. A [recent TV report "vantage" in the first post](https://youtu.be/kK3OfIdlgTw?si=yFxV58E5C7e_PNI9) 
explains that 80% of nearly 2 million graduating engineers are unemployable. The IT sector is one of the biggest
employers. However, only 5% of these have training in programming. The report says Cognizant which has a large 
presence in India offers only INR 20k per month (USD 240) to fresh engineering graduates which is lower than 
the average monthly salary of a driver or a housekeeper. The 
average annual pay for fresh engineers in most software companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Techm) has 
stagnated at INR 3-3.5 lacs (3500-4100 USD per annum) for the last ten years. 
  
The problem we should be worried about is: where do most of the rest 80% of aspirants end up? I believe at 
least 5% of the remaining aspirants are well prepared and still preserve the motivation to succeed given adequate
opportunities. The amount of collective investments in the aspirants is huge and borne entirely by their parents.
Perhaps a few of these aspirants may be supported by their parents to get quality education outside India, while 
the rest who succeed are essentially self-made. The educational institutions outside the handful of elite schools 
destroy any motivation that may still exist with the young aspirants. The whole scenario appears to turn the 
individual investments of a large number of Indian middle-class families into non-performing assets even if we
include any non-tangible gains out of the coaching industry. The coaching industry does not create wealth, unlike 
the manufacturing or service sectors do. It essentially transfers wealth from personal savings to a few proprietors
of coaching centers and in the process breaks the safety nets for the survival of a huge number of middle-class
families in India. The governments do not care as long as politicians get their cuts. They are only 
interested in latching onto political consultants (e.g., I-PAC) for devising ideas of freebies that can win 
votes. Admittedly, freebies work as social security for a large part of the population that lives in abject poverty.
However, these freebies drain out funds and leave nothing for CAPEX. Most state governments are spending close 
to 80% of the state's revenue receipts on freebies. I don't understand why the ECI or the courts have nothing
to say in this wonton plundering of tax-payer money for the exclusive benefits of the political class. Sadly, 
the constitution of India is inadequate in preventing the game plan of politicians. 

Of course, I understand a country cannot operate in a vacuum. There must be a power structure even in 
an avowed welfare state or a capitalist state. China and Russia have progressed quite well
under the "communist rules." However, we need to understand these two countries run a different
institutionalized dictatorship.  Mao Zedong, Lenin, and scores of other famous left-leaning leaders 
created dreaded power centers around a set of oligarchs around them. The oligarchy system essentially
bullied all resistance against them. Charismatic leaders succeed by creating a group of blind followers, 
as the godmen do. But nothing comes for free, the group of followers is adequately nourished and a few who 
ever aspire to challenge are severely punished. The process is simply "carrot and stick" which enabled 
so-called left-leaning leaders to create a strong bureaucratic setup in the army and governance. The
army is easy to control, but governance requires diabolical skills to quell 
all oppositions, no matter how. The classical quartet theory of "saam (fabrication or flattery), daam (greed), 
danda (punishment), bhed (divide)" works to build a pliant bureaucratic structure. Once that is done, there
is no stopping. That is also the success story behind all long-serving governments (state or center) in India.
A large part of the expenditure on freebies ends up in building so-called "party cadres" and 
serving no purpose except for bullying oppositions of any kind. We still find 
beggars, squatters, and hawkers occupying the streets of metros like Kolkata, Delhi, Bombay, 
Madras and Kanpur. I guess the situation in villages would be even worse. Our political class has failed us miserably. 

In an overpopulated country like India, everything is always in short supply. From medieval times India's
success depended mostly on service and trade. Wealth was concentrated among a few rich aristocrats.
The system hasn't changed at all. Tool creation had never been a forte of Indians. It was also the
reason why the country came under barbaric invasions by scores of foreign invaders like the Mongols,
the Moghuls, the Turkic, the Greeks, the Huns, the British, and other European races. The invaders had 
a much-improved armada. Very few Indian rulers were evenly matched with the invaders. The Indian 
collaborators (either bullied or bribed) made things worse for those who opposed invaders. The point
is Indians should learn to build.

An average Indian looks to get engaged in some way by dispensing service to others. Indians  
by nature are stragglers, not strugglers. An engineer, a doctor, a
teacher, a lawyer, or a bureaucrat has very little contribution in terms of innovations or discovery
of tools. Until now the number of patents filed in India did not reach even 100 thousand. The top four
states Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, UP, and Karnatak report patent filings of over 5k. West Bengal and Odisha
trail far behind at only 10% of the leader state. I guess, TN being the auto-industry hub accounts for
the highest number of patent filings. The figure rose by 46% in 2023 from 2022. The 2004 US patents
statistics show India had 363 utility patents,	9 design patents, and 4 plant patents. However, 
Indian patent filings are due to foreign companies. Most are related to technology and manufacturing. 
Leading companies are [Qualcum, Samsung, Huawei, Philips, Ericson, Microsoft, etc.](https://insights.greyb.com/india-patent-trends-and-statistics/). 
Among Indian educational institutions only LPU, IIT Madras, and IIT Bombay crossed the 1k mark. However, none of
these are in manufacturing. The patent applications were for pharmaceutical, medical, computer, 
IoTs, and environmental technology. The discussion on patents may seem entirely orthogonal
to the issue of the coaching industry in the country. I want the reader to understand where we stand 
in terms of rewarding innovators and the reason behind the country's over-reliance on the service sector
for economic growth. There are umpteen number of sociological reasons for it. 

We possibly cannot over-emphasize the reluctance of Indians to take risks. It is a case of survival of an entire 
family a typical middle-class Indian. If one member succeeds in becoming an Administrative cadre officer,
a Police Officer, a Doctor, an engineer, or a corporate honcho, the family survives. The coaching industry
thrives on this mindset. Corruption has permeated every strata of society. There is a fixer everywhere 
given the right prices. Most often people fall prey to cheaters and scammers. Yet, desperation gets the
better of them. Laws exist but the apparatus for dispensing justice is woefully inadequate. Our courts 
function as if Indians are "immortals." Leakage at every stage has
made people lose faith in every system. After all, it is a zero-sum game to be a middle-class
Indian. Suckers everywhere no one to give solace. I doubt if any coaching center will ever 
go out of business unless pulled down by its rivals.
