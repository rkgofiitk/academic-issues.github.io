# Coaching Centers Pulling Down Country's Economy

I am disturbed by the effect of coaching business growing to become the largest non-creator of 
wealth in the country. A country's growth depends on wealth creation much as activist and left liberals
berate everyone who believe in it. A decadant political system called left is abandoned even in its 
much cherised incubators like Russia and China. The idea of "wealth distribution" can never be fully
realized even in an equitable system as activists and their ecosystem want us to believe. It is true 
that with large part of population being in thores of abject proverty, then a nation cannot become a
viable economy much less a world class economy. However, making billionaires flee the country and 
lose interest in wealth creation would destroy a country's economy and make it go into debt trap. 
The reader may wonder why am I taking a dig on the leftist theory of wealth distribution and how am 
I going to relate it to coaching business? Let me elucidate on it.

A country cannot operate from vacuum. There must be a power structure even in avowedly left centered
nation. Mao Zedong, Lenin or Stalin, Fidel Catro, and scores of other famous left leaning leaders 
created dreaded power centers around by a set of oligarch around them. The oligarchy system essentially
bulied all resistances against them. Let us analyze how these power centers were created in the first 
place. Charismatic leaders always create a group of blind followers, like the godmen do. But nothing
comes for free, the group is adequately nourished and a few who ever aspire to challenge are severely
punished. The process is simply carrot and stick which enabled the left leaning leaders to create a 
strong bureaucratic set up in army and governance much like a dictator would do. The army is easy to 
control, but governance requires diabolical skill in  sense quell all opposition no matter how. The 
classical theory quartet "saam (fabrication or flattery), daam (greed), danda (punishment), bhed
(divide)" works to build a pliant bureaucratic structure. Once you are able to create one there is no
stopping. That is the success story behind all long serving governments (state or center) in India.

In an over populated country like India we have everything in short supply. From medieval time India's
success dependent mostly on service and trade. Wealth was concentrated among few rich aristrocrats.
The system hasn't changed at all. Tool creation was not an Indian forte. Therefore, an average
Indian look for getting engaged in some way dispensing service to others. An engineer, a doctor, a
teacher, a lawyer or a bureaucrat has very little contribution in terms of innovations or discovery
of tools. Until now the number of patents filed in India did not reach even one lac. Only four
states Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, UP and Karnatak report patent filings over 5k. West Bengal and Odisha
trail far behind at level of 0.8k. The trend is
growing.
