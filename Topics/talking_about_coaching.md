# Coaching Centers Pulling Down Country's Economy?

A country's growth depends on wealth creation much as activist and left liberals berate everyone who 
believes in it. Sustainable growth adds to GDP. Unless manufacturing industry accounts for 20% of GDP,
the growth will not be sustainable in long run. Indian growth story is led by service sector. It 
contributes 50% to India's GDP. Valued at nearly US$ 6.5 billion, coaching institutions in India 
contributes only 0.2% of country's GDP. As such India's academic institutions do not rank well compared
to those in US, Japan, UK, China, Singapore, South Korea or even Taiwan. The new NEP has not made any
impact on the ground. Yet, why is there so much focus on coaching institutions? After all, they 
prepare aspirants for entrance into medical sciences, engineering and management schools. Only at most
2% of the aspirants get admissions into a few elite schools in India. These include IITs, NIITs, IIMs,
AIMS, IISER, BITS Pilani, and a few other CFTIs. India has just about 150 ellite institutions are there.
A recent tv report "vantage" in first post explains 80% of nearly
2 million graduating engineers are employable. Only 5% of these have training in programming. 
According to this report, Cognizant which has a large presence in India offers only 20k PM to freshers
which is lower than the average monthly salary of a driver or a house keeper. The average annual pay 
for fresh engineers in most software companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Techm) has stagnated at 3-3.5 lacs for
the last ten years. 
  
The problem we should be worried about is: where most of the
90-92% aspirants end up with. I believe at least 5% of the remaining aspirants are well prepared and
still preserve motivations to succeed given adequate opportunities. The amount of collective investments 
on the aspirants is enormous and entirely borne by their parents. Perhaps a few of these aspirants may 
be supported by their parents to get quality education outside India while the rest who succeed are
essentially self-made. The educational institutions outside the handful of elite schools 
destroy any motivations that may still exist with the young aspirants. The whole scenario appears
to turn the individual investments of a large number
of Indian middle class families into non-performing assets even if we include non-tangible gains out 
of coaching industry. Coaching industry do not create wealth unlike manufacturing or service sectors.
It essentially transfers wealth from personal savings to a few proprietors of coaching
centers and in the process actually breaks the safety nets for survival of huge number of middle 
class families in India. The governments do not care. The politicians are only interested to 
latch onto the idea of devising freebie schemes that earn them votes.
Admittedly, freebies are needed for a large part of population that live
in abject poverty. However, instead of increasing CAPEX all state governments are spending close to
70% of state's revenue for freebies. A large part of the expenditure on freebies end up with buidling
party cadres and really serving no purpose except for creating literally "party cadres" (euphimism  
for goons). We still find 
beggars, squatters, and hawkers occupying the streets of metros like Kolkata, Delhi, Bombay, 
Madras and Kanpur. I guess the situations 
in villages would be worse. Our political class has failed us miserably. 

However, I believe a country cannot operate from vacuum. There must be a power structure even in 
avowedly left centered
nation. Mao Zedong, Lenin or Stalin, Fidel Catro, and scores of other famous left leaning leaders 
created dreaded power centers around by a set of oligarch around them. The oligarchy system essentially
bulied all resistances against them. Let us analyze how these power centers were created in the first 
place. Charismatic leaders always create a group of blind followers, like the godmen do. But nothing
comes for free, the group is adequately nourished and a few who ever aspire to challenge are severely
punished. The process is simply "carrot and stick" which enabled the left leaning leaders to create a 
strong bureaucratic set up in army and governance much like a dictator would do. The army is easy to 
control, but governance requires diabolical skill in  sense quell all opposition no matter how. The 
classical quartet theory of "saam (fabrication or flattery), daam (greed), danda (punishment), bhed
(divide)" works to build a pliant bureaucratic structure. Once you are able to create one there is no
stopping. That is also the success story behind all long serving governments (state or center) in India.

In an over populated country like India everything always in short supply. From medieval time India's
success dependent mostly on service and trade. Wealth was concentrated among few rich aristrocrats.
The system hasn't changed at all. Tool creation was not a forte of Indians at anytime. It is also the
reason why the country came under foreign invaders (mongols, moghuls, turkic, greek and hun) from
time to time in the past. The invaders had much improved armda.  Therefore, an average
Indian look for getting engaged in some way dispensing service to others. An engineer, a doctor, a
teacher, a lawyer or a bureaucrat has very little contribution in terms of innovations or discovery
of tools. Until now the number of patents filed in India did not reach even one lac. The top four
states Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, UP and Karnatak report patent filings over 5k. West Bengal and Odisha
trail far behind at only 10% of the leader state. I guess, TN being the auto-industry hub account for
the highest number of patent filings. The figure rose by 46% in 2023 from 2022. The 2004 US patents
statistics shows India had 363 utility patents,	9 design patents, and 4 plant patents. However, 
Indian patent filings are actually due to foreign companies. Most are related to technology and 
manufacturing. Leading companies are 
[Qualcum, Samsung, Huwei, Philips, Ericson, Microsoft, etc](https://insights.greyb.com/india-patent-trends-and-statistics/). 
Among Indian educational institutions only LPU, IIT Madras and IIT Bombay crossed 1k mark. None of
these are in manufacturing. The patent applications were for pharmaceutical, medical, computer, 
IoTs, and environmental technology. 

The discussion on patents may seem entirely disconnected with the issue of coaching industry in 
the country. I want the reader to understand where we stand in terms of rewarding innovators and
the reason behind country's over-reliance on service-sector for economic growth. There are umpteen
number of sociological reasons for it. We possibly cannot over-emphasize the reluctance of Indians
to take risk. It is a case of survival of an entire family a tyical middle class Indian if one
member succeeds to become an Administrative cadre officer, a Doctor, an engineer, or a corporate
honcho. Coaching industry thrive on it. You have fixer everywhere.
