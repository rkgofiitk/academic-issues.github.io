# Coaching Centers Pulling Down Country's Economy

I a bit disturbed by the effect of coaching business growing to become the largest non-creator of 
wealth in the country. A country's growth depends on wealth creation much as activist and left liberals
berate everyone against it. A decadant political system called left is abandoned even in its incubators
Russia and China. The idea of "wealth distribution" can never realize an equitable system as activists
and their ecosystem want us to believe. It is true that with large part of population being in thores of
abject proverty a nation cannot become a viable economy much less a world class economy. However,
making billionaires flee lose interest in wealth creation would destroy a country's economy and 
make it go into debt trap. The reader may wonder why am I taking a dig on leftist theory of wealth
distribution and how am I going to relate it to coaching business. Let me elucidate on it.

A country cannot operate from vacuum. There must be a power structure even in left centered nation.
Mao Zedong, Lenin or Stalin, Fidel Catro, and scores of other famous left leaning leaders created
dreaded power centers around them to bully all resistances against them. Let us analyze how these
power centers were created in the first place. It is true that these leaders had some amount of 
blind followers, but they were not many in numbers. So, they created a strong bureaucratic set up
in army and governance. Army is easy to control, but governance requires skill and diabolical in 
the sense all oppositions should be quelled no matter how. Pander to aspiration by promoting bureaucracy.
