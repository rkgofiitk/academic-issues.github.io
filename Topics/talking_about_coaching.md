# Coaching Centers Pulling Down Country's Economy

A country's growth depends on wealth creation much as activist and left liberals berate everyone who 
believes in it. Sustainable growth adds to GDP. Unless manufacturing industry accounts for 20%, the 
growth will not be sustainable. Indian growth story is led by service sector. It contributes to 50% of
India's GDP. Valued at nearly US$ 6.5 billion, coaching institutions in India contributes only
0.2% of country's GDP. The question then arises is: why do we worry about it's menace? They prepare
aspirants for entrance tests for Medical, Engineering, Law, Managements and a few other professional
courses. At most 2% of the aspirants get admissions into a few elite schools (IITs, NIITs, IIMs, AIMS,
IISER, and a few other CFTIs) in India. 
As such India's academic institutions do not rank so well compared to those in US, China, Singapore or
Taiwan. Implementation of NEP has not made any impact on the ground. Still why there is so much 
focus on coaching institutions? They prepare students for entrance into Medical colleges, Engineering
and Management schools. International standards. However, it has potentials to turn India into the largest non-creator of wealth in the country. 
 It is true 
that with large part of population being in thores of abject proverty, then a nation cannot become a
viable economy much less a world class economy. However, making billionaires flee the country and 
lose interest in wealth creation would destroy a country's economy and make it go into debt trap. 
The reader may wonder why am I taking a dig on the leftist theory of wealth distribution and how am 
I going to relate it to coaching business? Let me elucidate on it.

A country cannot operate from vacuum. There must be a power structure even in avowedly left centered
nation. Mao Zedong, Lenin or Stalin, Fidel Catro, and scores of other famous left leaning leaders 
created dreaded power centers around by a set of oligarch around them. The oligarchy system essentially
bulied all resistances against them. Let us analyze how these power centers were created in the first 
place. Charismatic leaders always create a group of blind followers, like the godmen do. But nothing
comes for free, the group is adequately nourished and a few who ever aspire to challenge are severely
punished. The process is simply carrot and stick which enabled the left leaning leaders to create a 
strong bureaucratic set up in army and governance much like a dictator would do. The army is easy to 
control, but governance requires diabolical skill in  sense quell all opposition no matter how. The 
classical theory quartet "saam (fabrication or flattery), daam (greed), danda (punishment), bhed
(divide)" works to build a pliant bureaucratic structure. Once you are able to create one there is no
stopping. That is the success story behind all long serving governments (state or center) in India.

In an over populated country like India we have everything in short supply. From medieval time India's
success dependent mostly on service and trade. Wealth was concentrated among few rich aristrocrats.
The system hasn't changed at all. Tool creation was not an Indian forte. Therefore, an average
Indian look for getting engaged in some way dispensing service to others. An engineer, a doctor, a
teacher, a lawyer or a bureaucrat has very little contribution in terms of innovations or discovery
of tools. Until now the number of patents filed in India did not reach even one lac. The top four
states Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, UP and Karnatak report patent filings over 5k. West Bengal and Odisha
trail far behind at only 10% of the leader state. I guess, TN being the auto-industry hub account for
the highest number of patent filings. The figure rose by 46% in 2023 from 2022. The 2004 US patents
statistics shows India had 363 utility patents,	9 design patents, and 4 plant patents. However, 
Indian patent filings are actually due to foreign companies. Most are related to technology and 
manufacturing. Leading companies are 
[Qualcum, Samsung, Huwei, Philips, Ericson, Microsoft, etc](https://insights.greyb.com/india-patent-trends-and-statistics/). 
Among Indian educational institutions only LPU, IIT Madras and IIT Bombay crossed 1k mark. None of
these are in manufacturing. The patent applications were for pharmaceutical, medical, computer, 
IoTs, and environmental technology. 

The discussion on patents may seem entirely disconnected with the issue of coaching industry in 
the country. I want the reader to understand where we stand in terms of rewarding innovators and
the reason behind country's over-reliance on service-sector for economic growth. There are umpteen
number of sociological reasons for it. We possibly cannot over-emphasize the reluctance of Indians
to take risk. It is a case of survival of an entire family a tyical middle class Indian if one
member succeeds to become an Administrative cadre officer, a Doctor, an engineer, or a corporate
honcho. Coaching industry thrive on it. You have fixer everywhere.
