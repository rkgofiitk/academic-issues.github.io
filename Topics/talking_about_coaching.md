# Are Coaching Centers Responsible for Pulling Down Country's Economy?

A country's growth depends on wealth creation much as activist and left liberals berate everyone who 
believes in it. Sustainable growth adds to GDP. Unless manufacturing industry accounts for 20% of GDP,
the growth will not be sustainable in long run. Indian growth story is led by service sector. It 
contributes 50% to India's GDP. Valued at nearly US$ 6.5 billion, coaching institutions in India 
contributes only 0.2% of country's GDP. As such India's academic institutions do not rank well compared
to those in US, Japan, UK, China, Singapore, South Korea or even Taiwan. The new NEP has not made any
impact on the ground. Yet, why is there so much focus on coaching institutions? After all, they 
prepare aspirants for entrance into medical sciences, engineering and management schools. Only at most
2% of the aspirants get admissions into a few elite schools in India. These include IITs, NIITs, IIMs,
AIMS, IISER, BITS Pilani, and a few other CFTIs. India has just about 150 ellite institutions are there.
A [recent tv report "vantage" in first post](https://youtu.be/kK3OfIdlgTw?si=yFxV58E5C7e_PNI9) explains 
80% of nearly 2 million graduating engineers are employable. Only 5% of these have training in programming. 
According to this report, Cognizant which has a large presence in India offers only INR 20k PM (USD 240)
to fresh graduates which is lower than the average monthly salary of a driver or a house keeper. The 
average annual pay for fresh engineers in most software companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Techm) has 
stagnated at INR 3-3.5 lacs (3500-4100 USD per annum) for last ten years. 
  
The problem we should be worried about is: where do most of the rest
90-92% aspirants end up? I believe at least 5% of the remaining aspirants are well prepared and
still preserve motivations to succeed given adequate opportunities. The amount of collective investments 
on the aspirants is enormous and borne entirely by their parents. Perhaps a few of these aspirants may 
be supported by their parents to get quality education outside India, while the rest who succeed are
essentially self-made. The educational institutions outside the handful of elite schools 
destroy any motivation that may still exist with the young aspirants. The whole scenario appears
to turn the individual investments of a large number
of Indian middle class families into non-performing assets even if we include any non-tangible gains out 
of coaching industry. Coaching industry do not create wealth unlike manufacturing or service sectors.
It essentially transfers wealth from personal savings to a few proprietors of coaching
centers and in the process breaks the safety nets for survival of huge number of middle 
class families in India. The governments do not care as long politicians get their cuts. 
They are only interested to 
latch onto political consultants (e.g., I-PAC) for devising ideas of freebies that can win votes.
Admittedly, freebies work as social security for a large part of population
that live in abject poverty. However, these freebies drainout funds for CAPEX. Most
state governments are spending close to 70% of state's revenue for freebies. I don't understand
why the ECI or the courts have nothing to say in this wonton plundering of tax-payer's money for
the benefits of political class. Sadly, constitution of India is inadequate in preventing
the game plan of politicians. 

Of course, I understand a country cannot operate from vacuum. There must be a power structure even in 
avowedly welfare state or a captialist state. China and Russia have progressed quite well
under the "communist rules." However, we need to understand these two countries run a different
version of communism. I would dare to say China and Russia actually practice a form of 
dictatorship. Mao Zedong, Lenin and scores of other famous left leaning leaders 
created dreaded power centers around by a set of oligarchs around them. The oligarchy system essentially
bulied all resistances against them. Charismatic leaders always create a group of blind followers, 
like the godmen do. But nothing comes for free, the group is adequately nourished and a few who 
ever aspire to challenge are severely punished. The process is simply "carrot and stick" which enabled 
so called the left leaning leaders to create a 
strong bureaucratic set up in army and governance much like a dictator would do. The army is easy to 
control, but governance requires diabolical skill to quell all oppositions, no matter how. The 
classical quartet-theory of "saam (fabrication or flattery), daam (greed), danda (punishment), bhed
(divide)" works to build a pliant bureaucratic structure. Once that is done, there is no
stopping. That is also the success story behind all long serving governments (state or center) in India.
A large part of the expenditure on freebies end up with buidling so called "party cadres" and really
serving no purpose except for bullying oppositions of any kind. We still find 
beggars, squatters, and hawkers occupying the streets of metros like Kolkata, Delhi, Bombay, 
Madras and Kanpur. I guess the situations in villages would be worse. Our political class has failed us miserably. 

In an over populated country like India everything always in short supply. From medieval time India's
success dependent mostly on service and trade. Wealth was concentrated among few rich aristrocrats.
The system hasn't changed at all. Tool creation had never been a forte of Indians. It was also the
reason why the country came under barbaric invasions of scores of foreign invaders like mongols,
moghuls, turkic, greeks and huns. The invaders had much improved armda. Very few Indian rulers 
were even matches with the invaders. 

An average Indian look for getting engaged in some way dispensing service to others. Indians  
by nature are stragglers not strugglers. An engineer, a doctor, a
teacher, a lawyer or a bureaucrat has very little contribution in terms of innovations or discovery
of a tool. Until now the number of patents filed in India did not reach even one lac. The top four
states Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, UP and Karnatak report patent filings over 5k. West Bengal and Odisha
trail far behind at only 10% of the leader state. I guess, TN being the auto-industry hub account for
the highest number of patent filings. The figure rose by 46% in 2023 from 2022. The 2004 US patents
statistics shows India had 363 utility patents,	9 design patents, and 4 plant patents. However, 
Indian patent filings are actually due to foreign companies. Most are related to technology and 
manufacturing. Leading companies are 
[Qualcum, Samsung, Huwei, Philips, Ericson, Microsoft, etc](https://insights.greyb.com/india-patent-trends-and-statistics/). 
Among Indian educational institutions only LPU, IIT Madras and IIT Bombay crossed 1k mark. However, none of
these are in manufacturing. The patent applications were for pharmaceutical, medical, computer, 
IoTs, and environmental technology. The discussion on patents may seem entirely orthogonal
to the issue of coaching industry in the country. I want the reader to understand where we stand 
in terms of rewarding innovators and the reason behind country's over-reliance on service-sector
for economic growth. There are umpteen number of sociological reasons for it. We possibly cannot 
over-emphasize the reluctance of Indians to take risk. It is a case of survival of an entire 
family a tyical middle class Indian if one member succeeds to become an Administrative cadre officer,
a Police Officer, a Doctor, an engineer, or a corporate honcho. Coaching industry thrive on this
mindset. There is fixer everywhere given right prices. Most often people fall prey to cheaters and
scammers. Yet, desparation gets better of them. Laws exist but aparatus for dispensing justice 
is woefully inadequate. Courts function as if humans are immortals. Leakage at every stage has
made people lose faith in every system. After all, it is a zero-sum game to be a middle class
Indian. Suckers everywhere no one to give solace. I doubt if any coaching center will ever 
go out of business unless pulled down by its own rivals.
