## Of Autonomy and Appointments in Academic Institutions

The British rulers framed India's modern education system. In 1857 three universities, one each at Calcutta, Bombay, and 
Madras started functioning. These universities were governed by rules similar to those in force at London University at the time. 
The British rulers did tinker with the administration and the policies to ensure that the university system did not provide
a catalyst for increasing opposition to the British rule from within India. However, there was still a highly vibrant academic atmosphere 
at the universities in India. The academicians not actively interested in opposing the British rule were largely unaffected. 
The system nurtured and allowed the scientists like Satyen Bose, JC Bose, Meghnad Shah, CV Raman, and others to 
carry out their academic activities. JC Bose was perhaps the most versatile and learned academician who was not 
recognized much, but CV Raman got a Nobel prize. 

Unfortunately, the older universities were unable to keep up either with the space of the progress or the aspirations of 
the gifted students. India witnessed a large-scale exodus of talented people to foreign universities. After the independence,  
the govt of the day realized that there was a massive shortage of engineers and technical experts. At the insistence of two 
prominent Indian members of the Viceroy's executive council, a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar was 
formed in 1946 before India gained independence from British rule. The committee recommended the establishment of four technical 
institutions in line with the MIT. The govt accepted the Sarkar committee's recommendations.

Possibly had it not been an initiative of the Indian members of the Viceroy's committee, IITs would not have seen the light 
of the day. Today, IITs have acquired a brand value that unscrupulous minds would always want to cash on from within the system. 
The organization of the IIT system is clearly defined under the Acts of IITs. Every IIT has a Board whose Chairperson is 
different from its Director. The Director of an IIT is its administrative and academic Head. The decision to keep the 
The Chairperson of the Board, separate from the executive Head is to provide a cushion against government pressures and enable 
the Directors to enjoy critical breathing space to make independent decisions regarding their institutions. The role of 
the IIT council was to perform liaison across IITs so that each one could adopt or adapt from the policies of the other 
from time to time. Over the years, the IIT council has become a proxy power center for the ministry of education to control 
IIT administrators (directors) instead of performing an advisory role.  

The procedure Followed by the Universities in Europe and USA Since the IIT system is modeled after MIT, the procedure followed
for the appointment of the MIT president should have significantly influenced the appointment of IIT Directors.
A brief outline of the procedure for selecting MIT's President is as follows. An 18-member faculty advisory committee along 
with MIT corporation committee on the selection of presidency interviews the faculty members in every department of MIT.  
It ascertains their views of the issues, the challenges, and the opportunities facing a new president. By extension, it
helps define the skills and the experience that a new president should have to become successful. 

Let us also look at the selection process of the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge and Oxford. Cambridge University has a 
governing board called the council. The council consists of 19 elected members from the following classes.
 
1. Four heads of the colleges 
2. Four Professors or Readers 
3. Eight members of Regent House 
4. Three current students of the university (one must be a graduate student) 

The Regent House is the principal electoral constituency of the university. It has more than 4500 members comprising 
university officers, heads of the depts, and fellows of the colleges. The Regent House elects one of the nominees as Vice-Chancellor 
from the list sent by the council. It is clear from the composition of the council that it has a significant say in the matters selection 
of the Vice-Chancellor rests on the direct stakeholders. The Regent House essentially performs the job of an oversight 
committee. 

Oxford University's structure is slightly different from that of Cambridge. It has a congregation and a council. The 
congregation performs the job of the Regent House like in the case of Cambridge University. It consists of 4000 members 
drawn from the university's academic staff, the heads of the departments, and other members of the governing bodies of the 
colleges. The congregation is empowered to change the statutes and the regulations, electing members to the council and 
appointment of Vice-Chancellor. The congregation is essentially like Senates of the University system in India but not as
politicized. Many members of the university senate system in India owe allegiance to parties, mainly the party in power in 
the state. 

We studied the general framework for the Presidents' appointments for the universities in the USA. The President's role is 
different from that of a Vice-Chancellor of a university in Europe or India. The President is the chief executive officer 
of a university. They work in close collaboration with the Provosts. The Provost is generally responsible for academic 
affairs. The faculty typically elects the Provost. The role of the President is to lead the fundraising efforts and 
foster a positive public image of the university and its academic community to the external world.

A governing board of a university possesses fundamental legal authority over the university. Harvard University, for 
example, has two governing bodies: (i) Harvard corporation and (ii) The board of overseers. Harvard corporation is a seven-
member executive body consisting of the President and the Fellows of Harvard College. The body of overseers consists of 30 
members elected by Harvard degree holders. Two boards have joint committees for appointments. Even with so many checks and 
balances, Larry Summers had to step down from the president-ship in June 2006 (Nature vol 440, pp 8-9, 2006), due to 
intense criticism from the academics (Nature vol 433, pp 190-192). It does go on to so not everything is hunky-dory with US 
university system. However, it does not generally affect the university's faculty or academic programs.

In summary, the appointment of chief academic and executive officer of an institute of higher learning, the world over, is 
decided solely by the direct stakeholders. Leaders can not lead unless they have the complete confidence of the faculty and 
the students.

The Directors of IITs perform the combined role of a President and the Provost. Sadly, the chairpersons of IITs have only 
ornamental role. In the past, most of these persons were either retired bureaucrats or retired corporate executives. They use
IIT tag only to enjoy perquisites or enhance their public image. None of them I know of have ever acted positively to further the
cause of faculty or academics. A few of these people sided with the MHRD when it wanted to dismantle IIT JEE during UPA rule.
University chancellors do not have any power. They act as instructed by the state politicians in power. So it is even more 
pathetic situation at State Universities.  In summary, neither IIT system nor the university system in India is politically
or academically insulated.   

Let us focus exclusively on IIT system because IITs mainly drive India's talent pool. We think the roadmap to evolve a good 
selection process and the refinement of the same over time should start with the transparency in the method. One good thing that has 
happened is the practice of advertising the post. However, the process of selection still rests almost entirely with MHRD. The IIT
Council acts as a proxy for the ministry of education. By extension, the person who becomes a Director is a proxy for the ministry.
It allows the minister and the education department to control the IITs by installing a pliable Director. The 
bureaucrats tinker with the academic policies at IITs in the mid-way. The senates of IITs have become nonfunctional bodies
to put the stamp of approval for the award of degrees. It has adversely affected IITs' autonomy and functioning so  
that their brand value has declined consistently. The deterioration has been pretty fast during the last 20 years. It has declined 
the stature of the academic community and overall degradation of the academic standards.

We, therefore,  propose a revamping the Directors' selection process. Provisions for adequate safeguards should be made to preserve 
the institute's autonomy. The Directors do not act as proxies of the ministry of education. For the starter, the faculty of each IIT should have a say in nominating the Director of IITs for the selection process. We 
propose as follows:

- The board of IIT for which the director appointment is due should spell out the short-listing process followed, 
the specific nominations made, the search committee's membership, and its report. 
- The search committee for short-listing should induct an elected representative of the IIT faculty. 
- The short list should be made available to the faculty for feedback. 
- The feedback should be taken as input. 

Sam Pitroda sent a letter to the then prime minister Manmohan Singh on the issues of the appointment of Directors and Chairpersons of 
governing councils/boards. It made a strong case for transparency and seeking inputs from academia and society. 

The two significant points of this letter are as follows:

1. The appointment of Directors/Vice-Chancellors of new IITs, IIMs, IISERs, central universities, and AIIMS must be made by a search   
    committee with an independent chair capable of exercising the highest quality of judgment. He says that the direct involvement of 
    Administrative Ministries can result in an unfortunate situation. 

2. The appointment of Chairpersons and members of governing councils/boards needs to be carefully crafted to benefit the 
   most comprehensive inputs from academia and society. The revamp and overhaul of the selection process should be on the following lines 
   in the future. 

Unfortunately, Sam Pitroda refrained from touching on the internal aspects of IIT's autonomy. Apart from inviting applications through
public advertisement, the selection process should incorporate views from faculty and students of respective IITs for which the
Director's appointment is being made. Since every IIT already has the Senate as a statutory body, it should seek feedback on the candidates by setting up a faculty advisory committee (FAC). 

We propose following composition of FAC:
<ol>
 <li> Senior-most Professor who is not an applicant for the post of Director </li>
 <li> Senior-most Associate Professor</li>
 <li> Three Senior-most Assistant Professors</li>
 <li> Five elected heads of departments </li>
 <li> One student member of the Senate. </li>
 </ol>

The FAC would thus consist of at least nine members, with the Chairperson being elected by the committee members themselves.
If the FAC gives negative feedback on any candidate, then that candidate's name should be automatically dropped from 
further consideration.

The candidates for directorial assignments should possess the following attributes. 
<ul>
  <li> They should be eligible for recommendation to the post of a senior professor at IITs and internationally acclaimed as eminent 
  scholars and widely respected in society. In this context, it is appropriate to mention the Kothari Commission report, which 
  states that a head of the institution stands for the institute's commitment to scholarship and pursuit of truth 
   (Kothari Commission report 1964-66, pp 334). </li>
 <li> They should not hold the position of Directors or heads of the institutes of national importance. We believe that if a candidate 
  has accepted a comparable position.  It should be understood that they have a certain vision and conviction regarding their 
  abilities to lead their chosen institution. Any explicit or implicit desire to switch a position afterward should be considered 
  a disqualification. The switching of positions disturbs the administrative set up in one institution and could potentially lead
  to foisting an unwilling person to the other. </li>
 <li> They should not have been past Directors of the IITs or served as a Vice-Chancellor of any university. It is more to ensure that no
  person should be given any extension beyond a 5-year term. A 10-year term (as has been the practice recently) is detrimental to the 
  institute's growth and its faculty. Conflict of views may arise from time to time between the chief administrator and many groups of 
  faculty members on the issue concerning institute academic governance. If chief administrators stay for extended terms, they may break 
  or make any employee's career. The faculty members are the most critical asset of an institution, so efforts must be made to ensure a 
  stress-free environment. </li>
<li> They should not have held any position at least in the last 15 years in the same institute for which they are being considered for a 
  Director's positions. Generally, it is found that such appointees, who benefit from being an insider, hold biased views and tend to 
  micro-manage the day-to-day affairs. We believe that the job of a Director is not micro-manage but to provide vision and outline a  
 roadmap for leading the institute to excellence. </li>
<li> They should not have been involved in intellectual plagiarism, sexual harassment, or criminal or financial embezzlement cases. 
 </li></ul>
 
After the candidates are short-listed, they should draw up a vision document outlining their roadmap to lead the institute.
FAC should be entrusted to invite feedback from the entire faculty on the vision documents, collate the feedback, and prepare an evaluation 
report on the suitability of the candidates. Top three candidates on the list should give a presentation to the institute's faculty. 
After that, the faculty advisory committee should give the visitor an ordered list of candidates. The visitor should make the 
appointment.


The institute's faculty should make a midterm evaluation of the Director. The faculty forum of the institute should be entrusted 
to collect the feedback through a web-based interface with proper encryption and anonymization. The evaluation results 
should be intimated to the Board, IIT council, and the Director. The input should be moderated appropriately to 
remove any derogatory remarks. The Director should be allowed to defend or present their views on which a 
joint committee of the Senate and the Board should a decide on extending or terminating the Director's term. The joint 
committee should consist of 

<ol>
<li>The Chairperson of the board  </li> 
 <li>One elected board member.  </li> 
<li>Two nominated members (other than govt representatives) of the board.  </li>
 <li>Senior-most Professor of the institute.  </li>
<li>Five elected heads of the department.  </li>
<li>Senior-most Associate Professor  </li>
<li>Senior-most Assistant Professor. </li>
 <li>One student Senate nominee </li>
 <li>One nominee from non-academic staff.</li>
 </ol>

There is a steady decline in the qualities and norms of public life and probity in India. The primary reason is the 
excessive interference by the politicians and the bureaucrat's nexus in the micro-management of institutions. While the 
resistance to interference is gaining ground, the extent of interference has also increased several folds. Unfortunately, 
the slow and sluggishness of the judicial review system has emboldened the nexus. By the time any court reaches a 
judgment, the relevance of court intervention has ceased, or the involved bureaucrats/politicians would have retired or died.  
Unfortunately, politicians were never caught or let off with at most a warning. The flow of funds has increased considerably in recent 
years. It has become a reason for aggressive political and bureaucratic interference in almost all public institutions.
