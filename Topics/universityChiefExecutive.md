## Of Academic Institutions, Autonomy, and Appointments

The British rulers framed India's modern education system. In 1857 three universities, one each at Calcutta, Bombay, and 
Madras started functioning. These universities were governed by rules similar to those in force at London University during the time. 
The British rulers did tinker with the administration and the policies to ensure that the university system did not provide
a catalyst for increasing opposition to the British rule from within India. However, there was still a highly vibrant academic 
atmosphere at the universities in India. The academicians not actively interested in opposing the British rule were largely unaffected. 
The system nurtured and allowed the scientists like Satyen Bose, JC Bose, Meghnad Shah, CV Raman, and others to 
carry out their academic activities. JC Bose was perhaps the most versatile and learned academician who did not get his due 
recognition. However CV Raman received the Nobel prize in Physics. 

Unfortunately, the older universities were unable to keep up either with the pace of the progress or the aspirations of 
the gifted students. India witnessed a large-scale exodus of talented people to foreign universities. In preparation for
power transfer, the Viceroy's executive council realized that there might be a massive shortage of engineers and technical experts. 
At the insistence of two prominent Indian members of the council, a 22-member committee headed by 
Nalini Ranjan Sarkar was formed in 1946. The committee recommended the 
establishment of four technical institutions in line with the MIT. The govt accepted the Sarkar committee's recommendations.
Had it not been an initiative of the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, IITs would not have seen the light 
of the day. Today, IITs have acquired a brand value that even unscrupulous minds find easy to exploit. 

The organization of the IIT system is clearly defined under the Acts of IITs. Every IIT has a Board whose Chairperson is 
different from its Director. The Director of an IIT is the administrative and the academic Head. The decision to keep the 
The Chairperson of the Board, separate from the executive Head is to provide a cushion against the government pressures and enable 
the Directors to enjoy critical breathing space and make independent decisions regarding their institutions. The role of 
the IIT council was to perform liaison across IITs so that each one could adopt or adapt from the policies of the other 
from time to time. Over the years, the IIT council has become a proxy power center for the ministry of education to control 
IIT administrators (the Directors) instead of performing an advisory role.  

Since the IIT system is modeled after MIT, the procedure followed for the appointment of the MIT president may have 
significantly influenced the selection of IIT Directors. A brief outline of selecting MIT's President is as follows. 

An 18-member faculty advisory committee and MIT corporation committee for the selection of presidency interview the 
faculty members in every department of MIT to ascertains their views. It identifies the issues and the challenges that 
a new President might face, and the opportunities that person could use to overcome them. The exercise helps define the 
skill set and the experience that a new president should possess to become successful. 

Let us also look at the selection process of the Vice-Chancellors of Cambridge and Oxford. Cambridge University has a 
governing board called the council. The council consists of nineteen elected members from the following constituencies.
 
1. Four Heads of the colleges 
2. Four Professors or Readers 
3. Eight members of Regent House 
4. Three current students of the university (one must be a graduate student) 

The Regent House is the principal electoral constituency of the university. It has more than 4500 members comprising 
university officers, heads of the depts, and fellows of the colleges. The Regent House elects one of the nominees as the Vice-Chancellor 
from the list recommended by the council. Therefore, the direct stakeholders have a significant
influence over the selection of the Vice-Chancellor. The Regent House is an oversight committee. 

Oxford University's structure is slightly different from that of Cambridge. It has a congregation and a council. The 
congregation is essentially an oversight committee like the Regent House of Cambridge University. It consists of 4000 members 
drawn from the university's academic staff, the Heads of the Departments, and other members of the governing bodies of the 
colleges. The congregation is empowered to change the statutes and the regulations, electing members to the council and 
appointment of Vice-Chancellor. The congregation functions more like a senate of the University system in India. However, the
congregation is not as politicized as the Senates are. Many members of the university Senates in India owe allegiance to the 
political parties, especially the ones in power. 

We studied the general framework for the appointments of the Presidents of the US universities. A President's role is 
different from that of a Vice-Chancellor of a university either in Europe or India. The Presidents are the chief executive officers 
of universities. They work in close collaboration with the Provosts. The Provost is responsible for academic 
affairs. The faculty typically elect the Provost. The role of the President is to lead the fundraising efforts and
foster a positive public image of the university and its academic community to the external world.

A governing board of a university possesses fundamental legal authority over the university. Harvard University, for 
example, has two governing bodies: (i) Harvard corporation and (ii) The board of overseers. Harvard corporation is a seven-
member executive body consisting of the President and the Fellows of Harvard College. The body of overseers consists of 30 
members elected by Harvard degree holders. Two boards have joint committees for appointments. Even with so many checks and 
balances, Larry Summers had to step down from the president-ship in June 2006 (Nature vol 440, pp 8-9, 2006) due to 
intense criticism from the academics (Nature vol 433, pp 190-192). Thus, everything is hunky-dory with US 
university system. However, it never affects the university's faculty or its academic programs.

In summary, world over, the appointments of chief academic and executive officers of an institute of higher learning is 
decided solely by the direct stakeholders. It is based on the principles that leaders cannot lead unless they have the complete 
confidence of the faculty and the students.

The Directors of IITs perform the combined role of a President and the Provost. Though an IIT is much smaller than a
university, the operational complexities are not any less. The dual role of academic Provost and Chief administrative
officer is a bit of overburden for a person. Sadly, the chairpersons of IITs have only an ornamental role. In the past, most of 
these persons were retired bureaucrats or retired corporate executives or emeritus academicians. They use
IIT tags only to enjoy perquisites or enhance their waning public images. None of them that I know of, have ever supported the
cause of either the faculty or the academics. A few of these people sided with the MHRD, who wanted to dismantle IIT JEE during
the UPA rule. They failed miserably primarily due to Senates of three older IITs, Kanpur, Delhi and Bombay. 

The Chancellors (the state Governors) of the state universities do not have any executive power. They act as instructed by the state 
politicians in power. Therefore, the situation at the State Universities is even more pathetic.  In summary, neither IIT system nor 
the university system in India is politically or academically insulated.   

Let us focus exclusively on IIT system because India's technical talent pool is mainly drawn from IITs. We think the roadmap to
evolve a good selection process and the refinement of the same over time should start with the transparency in the method. One good 
thing that has happened is the practice of advertising the post. However, the selection process is still controlled almost entirely 
by the ministry of education. The IIT Council acts as a proxy for the ministry. The person who becomes a Director, by extension, 
becomes a proxy for the ministry. It allows the minister and the dept bureaucrats to control the IITs by installing a pliable 
Director. The bureaucrats tinker with the academic policies at IITs in the mid-way. The senates of IITs have become nonfunctional 
with the exit of independent thinkers among the faculty. Its job is reduced to put the stamp of approval for the award of degrees. Nonfunctional
Senates have adversely affected IITs' autonomy. It has eroded the brand value of IITs consistently. The deterioration has been pretty
fast during the last 20 years. 

We, therefore,  propose a revamping the Directors' selection process. The Directors should not act as proxies of the ministry of 
education. Therefore, the faculty of each IIT must have a say in nominating the Director of IITs for the selection 
process. We propose as follows:

- The board of IIT for which the director appointment is due should spell out the short-listing process followed, 
- The specific nominations made for the post, the search committee's membership, and its report,
- The search committee for short-listing should induct at least one elected representative of the IIT faculty,
- The short list should be made available to the faculty for feedback, and 
- The feedback should be taken as input. 

Sam Pitroda sent a letter to the then prime minister Manmohan Singh on the issues of the appointment of the Directors and Chairpersons of 
governing councils/boards for institutes of national importance. It made a strong case for transparency and seeking input from 
academia and society. 

The two significant points of this letter are as follows:

1. The appointment of Directors/Vice-Chancellors of new IITs, IIMs, IISERs, central universities, and AIIMS must be made by a search   
   committee with an independent chair capable of exercising the highest quality of judgment. He says that the direct involvement of 
   administrative ministries can result in an unfortunate situation. 

2. The appointments of Chairpersons and members of governing councils/boards need to be carefully crafted to benefit the 
   most comprehensive inputs from academia and society. 

Unfortunately, Sam Pitroda's letter refrained from touching the internal aspects of the institution's autonomy. Apart from inviting 
applications through public advertisement, the selection process should incorporate views from faculty and students of the respective 
institute for which the Vice-chancellor/Director's appointment is being made. Since every institution already has the Senate as a 
statutory body, it could seek feedback on the candidates by setting up a faculty advisory committee (FAC). 

We propose following composition of FAC:
<ol>
 <li> Senior-most Professor who is not an applicant for the post of Director, </li>
 <li> Senior-most Associate Professor,</li>
 <li> Three Senior-most Assistant Professors,</li>
 <li> Five elected heads of departments, and </li>
 <li> Three student members of the academic Senate. </li>
 </ol>

The FAC would consist of at least eleven members, with the Chairperson being elected by the committee members themselves.
If the FAC gives negative feedback on any candidate, then that candidate should be dropped from 
further consideration.

The candidates for directorial assignments should possess the following attributes. 
<ul>
  <li> They should be eligible for recommendation to the post of a senior professor at IITs and internationally acclaimed as eminent 
  scholars and widely respected in society. In this context, it is appropriate to mention the Kothari Commission report, which 
  states that a head of the institution stands for the institute's commitment to scholarship and pursuit of truth 
   (Kothari Commission report 1964-66, pp 334). </li>
 <li> They should not hold the position of Directors or Heads of the institutes of national importance. We believe that if a candidate 
  has accepted a comparable position.  It should be understood that they have a certain vision and conviction regarding their 
  abilities to lead their chosen institution. Any explicit or implicit desire to switch a position afterward should be considered 
  a disqualification. The switching of positions disturbs the administrative setup in one institution and could potentially lead
  to foisting an unwilling person to the other. </li>
 <li> They should not have been past Directors of the IITs or served as a Vice-Chancellor of any university. It is more to ensure that no
  person should be given any extension beyond a 5-year term. A 10-year term (as has been the practice recently) is detrimental to the 
  institute's growth and its faculty. Conflict of views may arise from time to time between the chief administrator and many groups of 
  faculty members on the issue concerning institute academic governance. If chief administrators stay for extended terms, they may break 
  or make any employee's career. The faculty members are the most precious asset of an institution. So the institute must spare no effort to ensure a 
  stress-free environment. </li>
<li> They should not have held any position at least in the last 15 years in the same institute for which they are being considered for a 
  Director's positions. Generally, it is found that such appointees, who benefit from being an insider, hold biased views and tend to 
  micro-manage the day-to-day affairs. We believe that the job of a Director is not for micro-management but to provide vision and 
  policy outlines for leading the institute to excellence. </li>
<li> They should not have been involved in intellectual plagiarism, sexual harassment, or criminal or financial embezzlement cases. 
 </li></ul>
 
After the candidates are short-listed, they should draw up a vision document outlining their roadmap to lead the institute.
FAC should be entrusted to invite feedback from the entire faculty on the vision documents, collate them, and prepare an 
evaluation report on the suitability of the candidates. Top three candidates on the list should make presentations to the institute's 
faculty. The faculty advisory committee should give the visitor/chancellor an ordered list of candidates. The visitor/chancellor
should make the appointment from the list.


The institute's faculty should make a midterm evaluation of the Director. The faculty forum of the institute should be entrusted 
to collect the feedback through a web-based interface with proper encryption and anonymization. The evaluation results 
should be intimated to the Board, IIT council, and the Director. The input may be moderated appropriately to 
remove any derogatory remarks. The Director should be allowed to defend or present their rebuttals. A 
joint committee of the Senate and the Board can then decide on extending or terminating the Director's term. The joint 
committee should consist of 

<ol>
<li>The Chairperson of the board,  </li> 
 <li>One elected board member,  </li> 
<li>Two nominated members (other than govt representatives) of the board,  </li>
 <li>Senior-most Professor of the institute,  </li>
<li>Five elected heads of the department,  </li>
 <li>Two senior-most Professors, </li>
<li>The senior-most Associate Professor,  </li>
<li>The senior-most Assistant Professor, </li>
 <li>Three student senate nominees, and </li>
 <li>One nominee from non-academic staff.</li>
 </ol>

There is a steady decline in the quality and norms of public life and probity in India. The primary reason is the 
excessive interference by the nexus of politicians and bureaucrats in the micro-management of institutions. While the 
resistance to interference is gaining ground, the extent of interference has also increased several folds. Unfortunately, 
the slow and sluggishness of the judicial review system have emboldened the nexus. By the time any court reaches a 
judgment, the relevance of court intervention has ceased, or the involved bureaucrats/politicians would have 
retired or died.  Unfortunately, politicians are never caught or let off with at most a warning. The flow of funds has increased 
considerably in recent years. It has become a reason for aggressive political and bureaucratic interference in almost all public institutions.
