# Broken Education System

We hear a lot about India's success story. The success of a country is measured in terms of the strength of 
its economy. The US and China are the top two economies of the world. They compete with each other in 
creating their axes of influence, either with financial aid to economically weaker countries or political understanding 
with developed countries. The USA, for example, has been either directly engaged or by proxies to create 
conflicts where there were none. It helped the USA to sustain its defense industry and war machines well-oiled. 
It is not only able to retain the pool of scientific talents but also recruit talents from other countries. 
The comfort of the life of self and family that the US can provide made it easy for people to prefer to live
and work in the USA. On the other hand, China made its manufacturing sector strong and provided a work environment for its people. Chinese dictators like Deng Xiao Peng ruled China for a long time, which 
provided stability to nation-building. Deng was instrumental in creating China as a manufacturing hub of 
the world. He also encouraged private enterprises in the real estate and service sectors. It made China to
become a world power. 

As far as India is concerned, the success story started in 2014. MSME, startup, and significant CAPEX investments
propelled the country to a different growth trajectory. Despite being a country with multiple diversity
India could quickly rise from 10th to 5th in world economic rankings within nine years. In the last few years, startup 
culture created many opportunities for young people. For the success of startups, the country needs a 
large pool of talented young people. It requires the Indian government to invest heavily in educational institutions. Policy planners must have advised the government adequately on the issue. However, we should fix the country's broken education system. 

India inherited its education system from British rule. China's situation is different. British rule in parts of China did not substantially influence the Chinese education system. China's school system is broadly similar to elsewhere. A significant aspect of any Chinese system lies in implementing and enforcing norms. The primary level between 3-9 years is universal. All urban schools are publicly funded. Rural primary education is dependent on local resources. For many years, the Chinese school system has emphasized vocational education. China had restrictions on mainland students seeking admission into US universities. However, China created many autonomous special administrative regions. Students from these regions could pursue higher studies in foreign universities. During Deng's tenure, restrictions were removed. China introduced English as a compulsory subject in the high school curriculum, allowing its students to compete with the outside world. In 1978, English became a test subject for college entrance. Beginning with the 1990s, a considerable number of Chinese students started taking the GRE and TOEFL. China is now the biggest English education market in the world. There is a conscious effort to bring Chinese students to the world talent pool. Nothing happens in China without direct approvals of the CCCP. 

In contrast, India started abolishing the good things we inherited from British rulers. India had the unique 
advantage of having  English as the medium of instruction in college education. English was a major test 
subject in the middle and secondary school education. We had two papers in English at high schools around the 
1970s. West Bengal CPM was the first to dismantle English from primary and middle schools. Ironically, the CPM 
party, which draws its ideological link with CCCP, advocated the abolition of English as a test subject. The 
party argued that it puts a lot of stress to have a child learn three languages: mother tongue, Hindi, and 
English. Soon, other regional parties tried to ape CPM. It led to a deterioration of the English skills of 
Indians. 

The spread of education to rural regions is mainly dependent on government initiatives. Evangelical efforts 
were only confined to a few rural pockets. There were many hurdles in these efforts:

- The orthodox rural population refused to send their girl child to schools.
- The politicians soon realized that having a solid base of rural education would be counterproductive for their recipe of divide and rule policy.
- The human resources for running schools in far-flung, inaccessible rural regions was always a problem. The teachers were not interested in serving at those places. 
- It was hard to detect the dereliction of duties by teachers at far-flung places. 

The government has yet to attempt to build infrastructure, which may have eased these problems. 
As a result, we ended up having a broken education system. 

About 70% of enrollment is in government schools. So, government schools play a significant role in nation-
building. Right To Education (RTE) Act of 2009 guarantees free elementary school education for every child. 
However, the guarantee does not include quality of education. The government of India has introduced certain 
innovations to deal with the quality of education. ICT and AI-based tools are being increasingly introduced for 
imparting school instructions to children. However,  these tools have yet to reach rural areas where elementary 
education primarily depends on teachers. Even today, the rural schools in Bihar and Jharkhand are in terrible 
shape. Some schools operate primarily with guest teachers. These teachers neither have the commitment nor the 
knowledge to teach. Some of these teachers indulge in unethical acts of bullying kids and stealing from school 
funds and mid-day meal programmes for students. Panchyat-level politicians are crooks who aid and abet the 
dishonest acts of the teachers. No one bothers about the future of kids. All of these lead the country to a 
broken system of school education. The availability of modern technology-based tools is still awaited in these 
areas. I blame the state governments for the inability to upgrade the school education system. In one of my 
earlier blogs, I mentioned the [5T transformation](./Odisha5Tschools.md) system of the Odisha government. I 
don't have any information on the actual status of govt schools in rural areas of Odisha. However, it is 
important to know that at least one state government is working towards improving the elementary and middle 
schools in the state. I am yet to hear about any such efforts in other states. Instead, many state governments 
are creating a situation for shutting down government schools. Some of the existing infrastructure of schools 
being used for the party's political activities. As a result, the country has to deal with a broken education 
system. The apathy is reflected in every stage, including colleges and higher learning institutions. 

Another aspect of our broken education system is [the obsession to score 100% in exams]( https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/society-news-99-and-above-is-our-education-system-lost-besides-being-broken/329921). 
It has turned learning into a rat race. Parents push their wards to a limit where even one mark less than the 
maximum is considered not good enough. Prof. Rajendra Pratap  Gupta, a member of the NEP drafting committee, 
points out that the rat race breaks self-confidence even among those in the 90% bracket. Likewise, the 
inability to crack IIT JEE breaks or NEET breaks an aspirant's self-confidence. It leads to [the unfortunate premature end of the lives of many bright young people](./kotaSuicide.md). 
Prof. Gupta says we built only an examination system, not an education system. 

Let's examine the higher education system. About 4.6 crore students seek admission to colleges. Colleges are 
mostly affiliated to state Universities. We also have a few autonomous colleges that frame their syllabi and 
conduct exams to award degrees. Primarily, two regulatory bodies oversee the ecosystem of college education. 
University Grants Commission defines standards and provides funding to universities. However, affiliate 
colleges depend only on fees or grants-in-aid from state governments. AICTE formulates norms for technical 
education. However, the actual implementation of standards and conduct of examinations and certification comes 
under the realm of universities. So, it all depends on how well the universities are administered or managed. 
Student politics often creates disruption. Left-supported student unions are notoriously aggressive and create 
problems in the college's smooth conduct of classes, exams, or day-to-day functioning. So, the higher education 
system is also broken.

Unfortunately, the average voter does not understand the importance of the education system for a country's 
overall growth trajectory. Political parties promise only freebies like egg-rice or rasam-rice meals or a DBT 
of Rs 500/- to accounts. Freebies are designed to provide a "feel good" factor to people. The country's broken 
education system allows politicians to resort to trickery and exploitation of people's helplessness to their 
advantage and get votes to misrule the country. Unfortunately, even 75 years after the independence, the 
government is still working on an NEP and its implementation.
