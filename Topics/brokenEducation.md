# Broken Education System

[Blog Index](../index.md)

We hear a lot about India's success story. The success of a country is measured in terms of the strength of 
its economy. The US and China are the top two economies of the world. They compete with each other in 
creating their axes of influence with financial aid to economically weaker countries or political understanding 
with developed countries. The USA, for example, has been either directly engaged or by proxies to create 
conflicts where there were none. It helped the USA to sustain its defense industry and war machine well-oiled. 
It is not only able to retain the pool of scientific talents but also recruit talents from other countries. 
The comfort of the life of self and family that the US can provide made it easy for people to prefer to live
and work in the USA. On the other hand, China made its manufacturing sector strong and provided a work environment for its people. Chinese dictators like Deng Xiao Peng ruled China for a long time, which 
provided stability to nation-building. Deng was instrumental in creating China as a manufacturing hub of 
the world. Deng also encouraged private enterprises in the real estate and service sectors. It made China to
become a world power. 

As far as India is concerned, the success story started in 2014. MSME, startup, and significant CAPEX 
investments
propelled the country to a different growth trajectory. Despite being a country with multiple diversity
India could quickly rise from 10th to 5th position in world economic rankings. In the last few years, startup 
culture created many opportunities for young people. For the success of startups, the country needs a 
large pool of talented young people. It requires the Indian govt to invest heavily in educational institutions. 
Policy planners must have advised govt adequately on the issue. However, we should fix the country's education 
system. 

Since India inherited its education system from British rule, the UK's system should be a natural comparison of 
that of the Indian system. China's situation is different. British rule in parts of China did not substantially 
influence the Chinese education system. China's school system is broadly similar to places elsewhere. A 
significant aspect of any Chinese system lies in implementing and enforcing norms. The primary level between 3-
9 years is universal. All urban schools are publicly funded. Rural primary education is dependent on local 
resources. For many years, the Chinese school system has emphasized vocational education. China had 
restrictions on mainland students seeking admission into US universities. However, China created many 
autonomous special administrative regions. Students from these special administrative regions could pursue 
higher studies in foreign universities. During Deng's tenure, restrictions were removed. China introduced 
English as a compulsory subject in the high school curriculum, allowing its students to compete with the 
outside world. In 1978, English became a test subject for college entrance. Beginning with the 1990s, a 
considerable number of Chinese students started taking the GRE and TOEFL. China is now the biggest English 
education market in the world. There is a conscious effort to bring Chinese students to the world talent pool. 
Nothing happens in China without direct approvals of the CCCP. 

In contrast, we in India started abolishing the good things we inherited from British rulers. India had the 
unique advantage of having  English as the medium of instruction in college education. English was a major test 
subject in the middle and secondary school education. We had two papers in English at high schools around the 
1970s. West Bengal CPM was the first to dismantle English from primary and middle schools. Ironically, the CPM 
party, which draws its ideological link with CCCP, advocated the abolition of English as a test subject. The 
party argued that it puts a lot of stress to have a child learn three languages: mother tongue, Hindi, and 
English. Soon, other regional parties tried to ape CPM. It led to a deterioration of the English skills of 
Indians. Govt efforts mainly took up the spread of education to rural regions. Evangelical efforts were only 
confined to a few rural pockets. There were many hurdles in these efforts. Firstly, the orthodox rural 
population refused to send their girl child to schools. The politicians soon realized that having a solid base 
of rural education would be counterproductive for their recipe of divide and rule policy. Thirdly, the human 
resources for running schools in far-flung, inaccessible rural regions was always a problem. Teachers were not 
interested in serving at those places. It was hard to detect the dereliction of duties by teachers at far-flung 
places. The govt of the day has yet to attempt to build infrastructure, which may have eased these problems. As 
a result, we ended up having a broken education system. 

About 70% of enrollment is in govt schools. So, govt schools play a significant role in nation-building. Right 
To Education (RTE) Act of 2009 guarantees free elementary school education for every child. However, the 
guarantee does not include quality of education. The government of India has introduced certain innovations to 
deal with the quality of education. ICT and AI-based tools are being increasingly introduced for imparting 
school instructions to children. However,  these tools have yet to reach rural areas where elementary education 
primarily depends on teachers. Even today, the rural schools in Bihar and Jharkhand are in terrible shape. Some 
schools operate primarily with guest teachers. These teachers neither have the commitment nor the knowledge to 
teach. Some of these teachers indulge in unethical acts of bullying kids and stealing from school funds and mid-
day meal programmes for students. Panchyat-level politicians are crooks who aid and abet the dishonest acts of 
the teachers. No one bothers about the future of kids. All of these lead the country to a broken system of 
school education. The availability of modern technology-based tools is still awaited in these areas. I blame 
the state governments for the inability to upgrade the school education system. In one of my earlier blogs, I 
mentioned the [5T transformation](./Odisha5Tschools.md) system of the Odissa government. Though I have yet to 
learn of the actual status of govt schools in rural areas of Odissa, what is important is that at least one 
state govt is working towards improvement of the elementary and middle schools in the state. I have yet to hear 
about any such efforts in other states. Instead, many state governments are creating a situation for shutting 
down government schools. Some of the existing infrastructure of schools being used for the party's political 
activities. As a result the country has to deal with a broken education system. The apathy is reflected in 
every stage, including colleges and higher institutions of learning. 

Unfortunately, the average voter does not understand the importance of the education system for a country's 
overall growth trajectory. Political parties promise ignorant voters only freebies like egg-rice or rasam-rice 
meals or a DBT of Rs 500/-. Freebies are designed as "feel good" serum for the voters. It does not lead to any
real development. Freebies are contributing to fiscal deficit. About 12-20% of revenue receipt of a state
goes for funding freebies. So, no state government can spend in CAPEX needed for development of state.
