# Tranformative Impacts of AI on Software Engineering Jobs

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Open AI's CEO Sam Altman thinks that AI can perform jobs of Software Engineers having few years experience. Meta is already using
AI for coding. Meta have reportedly fired 31000 employees and pushing for hiring of machine learning engineers. Indian tech giants
like Infosys, L & T, Techmahindra, and TCS who rely on bodyshoping low quality software engineers will have to rethink their 
strategy of inducting everybody and anybody with a computer science degrees. Shareholders should perhaps go for a strategic 
reallocation of stakes in these companies. It is time that government's advisors on Nitiyug's board and economic affairs panel
become aware of implications of AI. Primeminister Narendra Modi is co-chairing AI Summit at Paris with French President Imanuel
Macron. I think PM is aware of the implication of AI applications in diverse field such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportation
and constructions on which nation building depends. 

[Sam Altman's blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/) on AGI (Arfificial General Intelligence) reveals that AI agents will be capable 
of coding like a software engineer of a top company with few years experience. Of course, we are aware that an AI agent's 
performance is limited to log of resources used to train them. Sam compares it to history human tool making. According to him AI
should be seen as yet another tool that human made. However, if we viewing AI as a tool is an understatement as it discounts AGI
factor and its impact on automated sharpening of the tool. Deep Seek model of distilled AI applying reasoning may tranform the
landscape of LLM-based approach and elevate it by adding a whole new dimension. Sam Altman observes that the cost of adding 
a given level of intelligence lowers by 10x every 12 months. The cost of a token fell by 150x in the period from GPT-4 to GPT-4o.
Deep Seek announced that its development cost is 6 million USD against 394 billion USD of Chat-GPT. However, a 
[new research](https://www.yahoo.com/news/research-exposes-deepseek-ai-training-165025904.html) exposes that the company only 
revealed its training cost. The development cost is estimated to be as high as 1.3 billion USD. Furthermore, Deep Seek has access
not only to 50000 H100 GPUs but a mix of H100, H800 and country specific H20 by Nvidia. Splitting hairs on Deep Seek's 
cost effiency against that of Chat-GPT 4o is not quite the end of story of the AGI's impactful effects on human community 
benefits. Sam Altman's blog and Meta's firing of 31k employees should be seen as in the context of a 
for a transformative computer scince and engineering curriculum for a transformative assessment of the curriculum for computer 
scince and engineering degrees.
