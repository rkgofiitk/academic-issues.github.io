# Tranformative Impacts of AI on Software Engineering Jobs

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Open AI's CEO Sam Altman thinks that AI can perform the jobs of Software Engineers with few years of experience. Meta is already using
AI for coding. Meta has reportedly fired 31000 employees and is pushing for hiring machine learning engineers. Indian tech giants
like Infosys, L & T, Tech Mahindra, and TCS, who rely on body shopping low-quality software engineers, will have to rethink their 
strategy of inducting everybody and anybody with a computer science degree. Shareholders should go for a strategic 
reallocation of stakes in these companies. It is time that the government's advisors on Nitiyug's board and economic affairs panel
become aware of the implications of AI. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is co-chairing the AI Summit in Paris with French President 
Imanuel Macron. PM is mindful of the implication of AI applications in diverse fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, 
transportation, and construction, on which nation-building depends. 

[Sam Altman's blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/) on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) reveals that AI agents will be capable 
of coding like a software engineer of a top company with a few years of experience. Of course, we know that an AI agent's 
performance is limited to the log of resources used to train them. Sam compares it to the history of human tool-making. According 
to him, AI should be seen as another tool humans have made. However, viewing AI as a tool is an understatement as it discounts the AGI
factor and its impact on the self-sharpening of the tool. Deep Seek model of distilled AI applying reasoning may transform the
landscape of LLM-based approach and elevate it by adding a whole new dimension. Sam Altman observes that the cost of adding 
a given level of intelligence lowers by 10x every 12 months. The token cost fell by 150x in the period from GPT-4 to GPT-4o.
Deep Seek announced that its development cost is 6 million USD against the
[cost of training](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/08/23/the-extreme-cost-of-training-ai-models/) 
Gemini 1 and chat GPT-4 range of 30-191 million USD. The cost 
excludes employee salaries employ equities, which can be around 29-49% of the final cost. However,  
[new research](https://www.yahoo.com/news/research-exposes-deepseek-ai-training-165025904.html) exposes that the company only 
revealed its training cost. The development cost is estimated to be as high as 1.3 billion USD. The development cost of
Chat-GPT is not revealed yet. According to some reports, Elon Musk offered a bid of 97.4 billion USD to buy out OpenAI. The 
operating cost of OpenAI is estimated at around 700k USD per day. Deep Seek's hardware inventory consists of
not only 50000 H100 GPUs but also a mix of H100, H800, and country-specific H20 by Nvidia. As Sam Altman narrates in his blog, 
splitting hairs on Deep Seek's cost efficiency against that of Chat-GPT 4o is not quite the end of the story of the AGI's 
impactful effects on human community benefits. 

Meta's firing of 31k employees and Altman's warning about the redundancy of Software engineers should be seen together in the 
context of a transformative computer science and engineering curriculum for a transformative assessment of the curriculum
for computer science and engineering degrees. AGI does not appear to be a buzzword anymore. Companies should recalibrate 
resources to retrain software engineers in AGI. However, given the current financial state of AI
tech companies, a judicious balance between retraining and curriculum change is the big takeaway from ongoing experiments
to deploy AGI to manage skilled professionals. How government advisors and policymakers invent strategies will be under 
microscopic scrutiny. Job loss in every sector will significantly increase competition's entropy in unorganized sectors.
