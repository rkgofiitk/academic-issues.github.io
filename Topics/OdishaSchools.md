## School Education System in Odisha

There was a full page ad on Oriya Daily about Odisha Govt's claim on transformation of 532 schools in the state. The ad states
that infrastructure of these schools has been upgraded under much hyped 5T  school transformation program. The govt apparently had target for
transforming over 3300 out of 4375 schools across states by the end of March 2022. However, till the end of May 2022, 532 schools transformations 
has been avhieved. The aim of the transformation program is to eliminate the existing gap between the urban and the rural centric schools. The 
transformation program mainly focuses on the infrastructure such as:
- Audiovisual equipment for teaching
- Access to e-libraries
- Access to well equipped science labs
- Comfortable seating space for student
- Overall swanky look of a modern classroom

The CM while dedicating the transformed schools to people of Odisha hoped that the students will have access to pedagogic training for 
a better foundational education at highschools. It will help them to be better prepared  for entrance tests in engineering or medical education.
Overall, it is indeed a laudable step which no other state govt has undertaken so far. An improved ambiance at the govt schools will increase
the enrollment. The craze for enrollment at the private schools will decrease. Hopefully the private schools will restructure the fees and
the high school education will become more affordable. It is indeed a win-win situation 
for both students and their parents. I believe govt is not thinking of raising fee structure. Even if the fee increases a bit, many parents
won't mind much. The govt may still continue to provide financial assistance to econonmically weaker sections of the students
and their parents. The CM has rightly pointed out that the state is making investment for the future which begins at the schools. If the
students receive quality education at high schools they are expected to excel in any chosen carrier options including engineering and medicine.

Unfortunately, I did not see any reference to one key area of a school transformation program. It pertains to employing adequate number of well 
trained teachers. Perhaps, the govt is already working on it. However, a news item on a popular daily news paper from Odisha is quite
disturbing to read. The evaluation of high school leaving examination is now being carried out in the state. The news item reports that 
the teachers for game and extracurricular activities are pressed for evaluating maths exam copies. Apparently, after the news appeared in print, 
steps are being taken to avoid such embarassments. However, one thing is clear there is a severe shortage of well trained teachers in the
govt schools. Creating infrastructure is short time-bound project. There are two aspect to overall upgradation or transformation of 
foundationational educatioon system.
