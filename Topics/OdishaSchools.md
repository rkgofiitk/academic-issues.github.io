## School Education System in Odisha

There was a full page ad on Oriya Daily about Odisha Govt's claim on transformation of 532 schools in the state. The ad states
that infrastructure of these schools has been upgraded under much hyped 5T school transformation program. I believe 5 Ts refer to the
overal govt  of travision of nsparency, technology, teamwork, time and transformation. It is not clear whether the 5Ts will permeat 
to school transformation program at the local level. However, I understand that the govt apparently had targeted for transforming over 3300 
out of 4375 public schools across the state by the end of March 2022. According to the govt sources, till the end of May 2022,  
transformations of only 532 have been avhieved. The aim of the transformation program is to eliminate the existing gap between the urban
and the rural centric schools. The transformation program mainly focuses on the infrastructure such as:
- Audiovisual equipment for teaching
- Access to e-libraries
- Access to well equipped science labs
- Comfortable seating space for student
- Overall swanky look of a modern classroom

The CM while dedicating the transformed schools to people of Odisha hoped that the students will have access to pedagogic training for 
a better foundational education at the highschool level. It will help them better prepared for entrance tests in engineering, medical and
other professional studies. Overall, it is indeed a laudable step which no other state govt has undertaken so far. An improved ambiance 
at the public schools will increase the enrollment. The craze for the private schools will decrease. Hopefully, the private school owners
will restructure the fees and the quality high school education will become more affordable. It is indeed a win-win situation 
for both students and their parents. I believe govt is not thinking of raising fee structure. Even if the fee increases a bit, many parents
won't mind much. The govt may still continue to provide financial assistance to econonmically weaker sections of the students
and their parents. The CM has rightly pointed out that the state is making investment for the future which begins at the schools. If the
students receive quality education at high schools they are expected to excel in any chosen carrier options including engineering and medicine.

Unfortunately, I did not see any reference to one key area of a school transformation program. It pertains to employing adequate number of well 
trained teachers. Perhaps, the govt is already working on it. However, a news item on a popular daily news paper from Odisha is quite
disturbing to read. The evaluation of high school leaving examination is now being carried out in the state. The news item reports that 
the teachers for game and extracurricular activities are invited for evaluation maths exam copies. Apparently, after the news appeared in 
print, steps are being taken to avoid further embarassments. However, one thing is clear there is a severe shortage of well trained teachers
in the govt schools. 

Creating infrastructure is a time-bound, one time investment. Maintaining the infrastructure is a more difficult proposition. Untrained
teachers will not allow the students to use new facilities. The school will put the equipment under locks in Cupboards and storerooms. 
Some of the audio-visual equipement will be used for entertainment or some will be diverted to living rooms of powerful
breaucrats or local level politicians. In my opinion if the creation facilities without proper planning is a wastage taxpayers money. 

There are two very aspects to real upgradation or transformation of foundational education system. 
- The availability of well trained, dedicated teachers
- Creation and maintenance of the school infrastructure and ambiance

The first one is extremely important, because the students at impressionable age look up for a role models. The first educators become their
most preferred role models.  Investing in human resources is extremely important, especially for nation building. Providing better pay and 
allowing open competitive teacher recruitment could make a truly transformational change in school education system in India. I have a few 
suggestions here:
- Make recruitment of teachers open all across India,
- Restructure pay-package to attract best talents even outside the state,
- Allow schools to make limited changes to suit to local conditions and special needs of students,
- Use standardized text in subjects like science, maths and social sciences,
- Choice of Literature texts may vary,
- Use National Test Agency to conduct eligibility test for recruitment of teachers,
- Create an independent commission like PSC to conduct interviews of eligible candidates.

Perhaps my suggestions will sound like a wishlist under prevailing political scenario. However, I believe these measures can only insulate the
recruitment from interferences of bureaucrats and politicians. It can make a truly transformational change in highschool education system.
