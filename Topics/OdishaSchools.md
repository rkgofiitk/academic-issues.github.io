## School Education System in Odisha

There was a full page ad on Oriya Daily about Odisha Govt's claim on transformation of 532 schools in the state. The ad states
that infrastructure of these schools has been upgraded under much hyped 5T  school transformation program. The govt apparently had target for
transforming over 3300 out of 4375 schools across states by the end of March 2022. However, till the end of May 2022, 532 schools transformations 
has been avhieved. The aim of the transformation program is to eliminate the existing gap between the urban and the rural centric schools. The 
transformation program mainly focuses on infrastructure such as:
- Audiovisual equipment for teaching
- Acess to e-libraries
- Access to well equipped science labs
- Comfortable seating space for students
The CM while dedicating the transformed schools to people of Odisha hoped that students will have access to better pedagogic training for 
foundational education at highschools. Overall, it is indeed a laudable step which no other state govt has undertaken so far. An improved 
ambiance at govt schools is certainly going to increase the enrollment. Preference for private schools will decrease. It is a win-win situation 
for both students and their parents. I believe govt is not thinking of raising fee structure. Even if fee increases a bit, I believe that
many parents won't mind much. I believe govt may continue to provide financial assistance to econonmically weaker sections of the students
and their parent. The CM has rightly pointed out that investment for the future begins with the schools. If students receive quality education
at schools they are expected to excel in any chosen carrier options including engineering and medicine.

Unfortunately, I did not see any reference to one key area of a school transformation program. It pertains to employing adequate number of well 
trained teachers. Possibly, the govt is already working on it. However, a news item on a popular daily news paper from Odisha is quite
disturbing to read. The evaluation of high school leaving examination is now being carried out in the state. The news item reports that 
the teachers for game and extracurricular activities are pressed for evaluating maths exam copies. Apparently, after the news appeared in print, 
steps are being taken to avoid such embarassments. However, one thing is clear there is a severe shortage of well trained teachers in the
govt schools. Creating infrastructure is short time-bound project. There are two aspect to overall upgradation or transformation of 
foundationational educatioon system.
