## 5T Transformation of School Education System in Odisha

There was a full-page ad on Oriya Daily about Odisha Govt's claim on the transformation of 532 schools in the state. The ad states
that the infrastructure of these schools has been upgraded under much-hyped 5T school transformation program. I believe 5 Ts refer to the
overall govt vision of transparency, technology, teamwork, time, and transformation. It is unclear whether the 5Ts will permeate 
to school transformation programs at the local level. However, I understand that the govt had targeted transforming over 3300 
out of 4375 public schools across the state by the end of March 2022. According to the govt sources, till the end of May 2022,  
transformations of only 532 have been achieved. The transformation program aims to eliminate the existing gap between the urban
and the rural centric schools. The transformation program mainly focuses on the infrastructure, such as:
- Audio-visual equipment for teaching
- Access to e-libraries
- Access to well-equipped science labs
- Comfortable seating space for student
- Overall swanky look of a modern classroom

The CM, while dedicating the transformed schools to the people of Odisha, hoped that the students would have access to pedagogic training for 
a better foundational education at the high school level. It will help them better prepare for engineering, medical, and
other professional studies entrance tests. Overall, it is indeed a laudable step that no other state govt has undertaken so far. An improved 
ambiance at the public schools will increase enrollment. The craze for private schools will decrease. Hopefully, the private school owners
will restructure the fees, and the quality of high school education will become more affordable. It is indeed a win-win situation 
for both students and their parents. I believe govt is not thinking of raising the fee structure. Even if the fee increases slightly, many 
parents won't mind much. The govt may continue to provide financial assistance to economically weaker sections of the students
and their parents. The CM has rightly pointed out that the state is investing for the future, which begins at the schools. If the
students receive a quality education at high school, they are expected to excel in any chosen carrier options, including engineering and 
medicine.

Unfortunately, I did not see any reference to one key area of a school transformation program. It pertains to employing an adequate number of 
well-trained teachers. Perhaps, the govt is already working on it. However, a news item in a popular daily newspaper from Odisha is quite
disturbing to read. The high school-leaving examination evaluation is now being carried out in the state. The news item reports that 
the teachers for game and extracurricular activities are invited for evaluation maths exam copies. Apparently, after the news appeared in 
print, steps are being taken to avoid further embarrassment. However, one thing is clear there is a severe shortage of well-trained teachers
in the govt schools. 

Creating infrastructure is a time-bound, one-time investment. Maintaining the infrastructure is a more difficult proposition. Untrained
teachers will not allow the students to use new facilities. The school will put the equipment under locks in Cupboards and storerooms. 
May be a few of this audio-visual equipement will be used for entertainment, or a few others will end up in the living rooms of powerful
bureaucrats or local level politicians. If the creation of facilities without proper planning is a waste of taxpayers' money. 

There are two aspects to real upgradation or transformation of the foundational education system. 
- The availability of well trained, dedicated teachers
- Creation and maintenance of the school infrastructure and ambiance

The first one is critical because the students at impressionable ages look up to role models. The first educators become their
most preferred role models.  Investing in human resources is extremely important, especially for nation-building. Providing better pay and 
allowing open competitive teacher recruitment could make a truly transformational change in the school education system in India. I have a few 
suggestions here:
- Make recruitment of teachers open all across India,
- Restructure the pay package to attract the best talents even outside the state,
- Allow schools to make limited changes to suit to local conditions and unique needs of students,
- Use standardized text books for subjects like science, maths, and social sciences,
- Choice of Literature texts may vary,
- Use National Test Agency to conduct eligibility tests for the recruitment of teachers,
- Create an independent commission like PSC to conduct interviews of eligible candidates.

Perhaps my suggestions will sound like a wishlist under the prevailing political scenario. However, I believe these measures can only 
insulate the recruitment from interferences of bureaucrats and politicians. It can make a truly transformational change in the high
school education system.
