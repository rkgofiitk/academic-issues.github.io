## 5T Transformation of Schools in Odisha

I described about the public schools in Jharkhand in one of my recent blogs. The state seems to have abdicated its responsibilities 
in guaranteeing a minimum middle and elementary-level school education. It is heartening to see the opposite in the neighboring state
of Odisha. 

Recently, I saw a full-page advertisement regarding the Odisha government's claim to have transformed 532 schools in the state. According to 
the ad, these schools' infrastructure has been updated as part of the much-hyped 5T school transformation program. Transparency, 
technology, teamwork, time, and transformation, are the five Ts that describe the government'sÂ vision for the state. It is uncertain whether
the 5Ts will find their way into local school reform projects. The government had set a goal of transforming over 3300 of the 
state's 4375 public schools by March 2022. However, only 532 transformations have been completed by the end of May 2022. The goal 
of the transformation initiative is to close the gap between urban and rural centric schools. The transformation initiative is primarily 
concerned with infrastructure, including:
- Audio-visual equipment for teaching
- Access to e-libraries
- Access to well-equipped science labs
- Comfortable seating space for student
- Overall swanky look of a modern classroom

While dedicating the renovated schools to the people of Odisha, the chief minister hoped that the students in the state's public schools would 
have access to pedagogic training for a stronger foundational education. It will assist them in better preparing for entrance exams for 
engineering, medicine, and other professional degrees. Overall, it is a commendable initiative that no other state government has taken to yet. 
Enrollment will rise as the ambiance in public schools improves. The popularity of private schools will wane. Hopefully, the fees will be 
restructured by the private school owners, and high school education will become cheaper. For both students and their parents, this is a 
win-win situation. I don't believe the government is considering raising the school fee structure. Even if the charges rise a little, 
many parents will be unconcerned. The government may also continue to provide financial help to students and their economically disadvantaged parents. The CM is correct in stating that the state is investing in the future, which begins in the classrooms. 
Students who acquire a good high school education are expected to succeed in any chosen career path, including engineering and medicine.

I was disappointed to find no mention of a critical aspect of a school transformation program. It has to do with having a sufficient 
number of well-trained teachers on staff. The government may be already working on it. However, a piece of news in a prominent
Odisha daily newspaper is rather upsetting to read. In the state, the high school-leaving examination is now being evaluated. According to 
the news item, game and extracurricular activity teachers have been invited to grade maths exam copies. Following the news publication, it 
appears that precautions are being made to avert additional embarrassment. One thing is sure:  
there is a chronic scarcity of well-trained teachers at government institutions. 


Infrastructure development is a one-time, limited expenditure. It is more challenging to keep the infrastructure up to date. Untrained teachers
will deny kids access to new facilities. The school will secure the equipment in cupboards and storerooms with locks. Possibly, some of this
audio-visual equipment will be used for entertainment, while others will end up in the homes of important officials or local politicians. 
If it happens then, school transformation will be a complete waste of taxpayers' money. 

The actual upgrade or transformation of the high school education system has two parts.
- The availability of well trained, dedicated teachers
- Creation and maintenance of the school infrastructure and ambiance

The first is crucial because young kids look up to role models. They consider their first teachers as initial role models. Investing in human
resources is critical, especially when it comes to nation-building. Better remuneration and open competitive teacher recruitment could 
result in a truly transformative improvement in India's school education system. I have a few suggestions on it:
- Make recruitment of teachers open all across India,
- Restructure the pay package to attract the best talents even outside the state,
- Allow schools to make limited changes to suit to local conditions and unique needs of students,
- Use standardized textbooks for subjects like science, maths, and social sciences,
- Choice of Literature texts may vary,
- Use National Test Agency to conduct eligibility tests for the recruitment of teachers,
- Create an independent commission like PSC to conduct interviews of eligible candidates.

My recommendations may sound like a wish list considering the level of bureaucratic and political meddlings in education system in India. 
I believe that these procedures will not only restore sanctity of the recruitment process but will bring a truly transformational change in
foundational education system in the country. Even without that the initial efforts of the govt of Odisha in this direction are appreciable.
