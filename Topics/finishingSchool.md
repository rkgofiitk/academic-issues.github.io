## Upskilling Engineering Graduates 

Engineering seats in technical schools in India picked over 320000 during 2013-2014. From 2015-2016 many colleges started applying for closures.Engineering 
seats declined from then onwards. In 2021, [AICTE](https://www.aicte-india.org/) announced the closure of sixty-three engineering colleges across India. 
Seats have fallen to the lowest in the last ten years. It is now around 230000, a decline of nearly 100000 at the rate of 10000 per year. 

At the same time, many upskilling schools have appeared in the education sector. Of course, most upskilling schools are operating in the following three segments.
- K12 segment 
- Coaching for medical/engineering entrance examination
- Programming tools and techniques segments

There is hardly any upskilling schools for humanities and social sciences. 
There is possibly not enough interest in acquiring skills in humanities social sciences, or creating a time-tested framework of skills
in the area is challenging. I believe that the latter is true. Leaving upskilling in the HSS area aside for the moment, let us understand the requirements 
upskilling in the three segments mentioned above.
The requirement in the K12 segment is quite apparent. By and large, it is believed that a foundation for higher education begins with middle and
high education. So most parents would happily invest in skill developments of their wards for K12 education. Some early startups like BAYJU'S
have cashed on 
it. BYJU'S reported turnover is about 2400cr in 2019-2020, up by 1300cr from 2018-2019. Now multinational companies like 21KSchool are also logging into
the lucrative market with Indian collaborators. [India global business](https://www.indiaglobalbusiness.com/industry/education/why-indias-online-education-market-will-grow-10x-in-5-years) reports 
that according to Bangaluru-based research firm RedSeer the eduTech market in India is poised to reach a staggering US$5 billion in 2025.

JEE, GATE, and NEET examinations primarily drive the requirement for the Coaching segment. JEE (Joint Entrance for Engineering) is a common test for 
admission to engineering across NIIT, IITs, IIESTs, and other CFTIs. GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineering) is initially designed for M. Tech 
admissions to IITs and IISc. It soon became a standard even for recruitments graduate engineers in many Public and Private sectors companies. NEET 
(National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)   for admission into Medical and Dental schools in India. One of my students is a founder of online coaching for 
GATE. They employ an interesting business model to create content. They pay handsomely to students who can create technically vetted content for 
fundamental topics in engineering subjects.  

However, the third segment is a bit disorganized. Its focus is on acquiring the skill to become a software developer. While tips and toy development 
scenarios can be very helpful, they are not entirely sufficient to become productive even after going through the certification regimen. Therefore, many 
small units have sprung across the country to offer onsite upskilling of DevOps training. I am not sure what they teach. But they do charge a lot sometimes 
with the promise of placements. Many of these small setups are head hunters who double up as finishing schools. I am not sure if they are doing a service or 
largely encashing on the naivety of students and their parents. A root cause analysis suggests that the UG CS program across India is in terrible shape 
except for a few IITs, NIITs, and IISc. The demand for DevOp jobs is much more than supply. Under this scenario, there is a requirement for bootstrapping CS 
education across India. I believe institutions offering UG or PG degrees should either shut down or shape up to the market requirements. Instead of 
employing babysitters for the class, they must hire technically competent teachers and offer them competitive salaries. It will also save them from
the embarrassment of closure. The AICTE, as a watchdog of technical education, has not been doing what it should have done.
