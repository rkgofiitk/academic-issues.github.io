# Technical Education in Vernacular Languages

[Blog Index](../index.md)

I had an enriching experience talking to an audience of educators in Odia at BITS, 
Mesra. The 3-day workshop was sponsored by AICTE under a scheme called VANNI. The 
scheme was mooted to initiate students in plus two grades in schools to 
learn technical topics. When we were at schools, up to grade 10, we were
only taught in vernacular languages with a generous mix of technical terms in
English. However, the plus two stages (pre-university) were attached
to colleges, where the lectures were only in English. There was a sudden phase change
in learning. Initially, we had problems being accustomed to asking questions 
to professors or interrupting them to seek clarifications when we did not understand
certain concepts. By the time we were getting somewhere on learning and engaging
the professors in the class, the year was over.  Many of us performed terribly in
pre-university exams. 

As a teacher, I also had a share of my experience with students who approached me
with problems of having difficulties in understanding lectures or completing assignments
because of language-related difficulties. I particularly remember a student who
after much prodding disclosed that he was facing trouble in following lectures and
did not know how to complete assignments. He won't even understand Hindi. His native 
language is Telegu. It was a difficult situation, I did not know how I could 
help him. Fortunately, I could find a TA who was fluent in Telegu. I request him
to help the students and gradually initiate him to the English medium. 
Barring a few elite schools, both govt and private schools have ill-trained 
teachers. Most of these teachers probably are for babysitting rather than focusing 
educating the students. The politicians cutting across party lines deliberately 
plan to prevent access to quality education beyond the reach of common 
people. Somehow society in general is not smart enough to
realize it. The learning at schools has now been relegated to 
passing a board examination. The phase shift in learning, especially in technical 
education, has now become a big problem for any technical discipline due to sudden
changes in the medium of instruction.  Given this background, AICTE's VANNI 
scheme seems to be a good initiative. 

I am sure that experts with AICTE appreciate two difficult aspects of the success 
of VANNI: 
- Fast creation of technical textbooks in vernacular languages.
- Simplification or adaptation of vernacular languages for technical education.

First one is easily achievable and probably AICTE may have already started scouting
talented authors. Let me deal only with the second aspect. While delivering my talk in Odia I found
myself completely inadequate to spit out even ten words in Odia. The term AI with
transliteration sounded more "artificial" than "artificial intelligence." Odia is a 
phonetically rich language, it has many consonants and lots of vowels as is with
other Indian languages. However, when spoken, Odia retains most of its vowel sounds, 
unlike Hindi and Bengali. I can speak reasonably fluently in Hindi and Bengali. When
it comes to Odia, the vowel sounds are a bit difficult for a correct way of pronounciation.
Speaking is not the only problem, the language has a lot of consonants and mixed alphabets 
that make it difficult even for a native speaker to write a piece of text without spelling 
mistakes. I am sure that other vernacular languages have their fair share of 
difficulties. While interacting with the audience (most of whom were native speakers)
I found all of them have difficulties in expressing the correct meaning of a technical
term like "generative" in Odia. There is a difference of opinion on 
whether the equivalent word for <i>intelligence</i> in Odia  could be <i>medha</i>
or <i>buddhimatta</i>. What could be the correct Odia equivalent word for intelligence quotient? 
Many in the audience were left wondering if there is a synonymous
term in Odia for many other technical terms. I thought that my
handicap in Odia stemmed from the fact that I am not a native speaker of Odia 
but learned the language as I had schooling in Odisha. However, it appears there
are inherent problems with all languages derived from Sanskrit. Sanskrit is 
a more developed and richer language compared to Classical Latin, Continental-Romance
or Germanic Languages. But no one uses Sanskrit or Latin for technical education 
except for translation. 

Considering the anticipated difficulties the educators may experience for 
delivering content in vernacular language,
I believe that there is an urgent need for AICTE to deal with the simplification
of vernacular languages. I don't think linguists alone can be entrusted
with the task. Linguists, sometimes, have preconceived notions of the purity of a
language. I think they may be ill-equipped to handle the problem and the
requirements of simplifying or enriching a language suitably to be used
as the medium of instruction for technical disciplines.
