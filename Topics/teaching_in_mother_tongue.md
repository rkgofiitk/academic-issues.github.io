# Tech Education in Vernacular Languages

I had an enriching experience talking to an audience of educators in Odia at BITS, 
Mesra. The 3-day workshop was sponsored by AICTE under a scheme called Vanni. The 
scheme was mooted for initiation of students in plus two grade in schools for 
learning technical topics. When we were at schools, up to grade 10, our teachers
only taught in vernacular languages with a generous mix up technical terms in
English. However, the plus two stage (which was called pre-university) were attached
to colleges, where teachers only taught in English. There was a sudden phase change
in learning. Initially, we had problems of being accostomed to asking questions 
to teachers or interrupting them to seek clarifications when we did not understand
certain concepts. By the time we were getting somewhere on learning to engage
teachers in class, the year was over and we performed terribly at pre-university 
exams. 

As a teacher, I also had a share of my experience with students who approached me
with problem of having difficulties in understanding lectures or doing assignments
because of language related difficulties. I particularly remember a student who
after much prodding disclosed he was unable to submit class assignments because
he was neither able to follow the lecture nor assignment problem. He did not even
understand Hindi as his native language is Telegu. I had to find a TA who was 
fluent in Telegu to help him and gradually initiated him to the English medium. 
I find school teachers barring a few elite schools are ill-trained and probably
are performing more of baby-sitting than focusing in teaching students. So, the 
learning at schools relegated to passing a board examination. Therefore, phase
shift in learning, especially in technical education, has now become a big 
difficulty for engineering, medical or any technical disciplines due to sudden
chang in medium of instructions. Consequently, AICTE's Vanni scheme seems to be
a good initiative. 

I am sure that experts with AICTE appreciate two difficult aspects of success 
of Vanni: 
- Fast creation of technical text-books in vernacular languages.
- Simplification or adaptation of vernacular languages for technical education.

Let me deal only with the second aspect. While delivering my talk in Odia I found
myself completely inadequate to tell even ten words in AI. Even the term AI with
transliteration sounded artificial. Odia is a phonetically rich language, it had
many consonent and lots of vowels as is with other languages. However, when spoken
Odia retains most of its vowel sound unlike Hindi and Bengali. I can speak
reasonably fluently in Hindi and Bengali. When it comes to Odia the vowel sounds 
are bit difficult. Speaking is not the only problem, the language has lot of 
consonent and mixed alphabets that makes it difficult even a native speaker to
write a piece without spelling mistakes. I am sure that other vernacular languages
have fair share of similar difficulties. While interacting with audience (most of
whom are native speakers) I found, all of them have difficulties in expressing 
correct meaning of a technical term like "generative" in Odia. We were left 
wondering if there is synonymous term for the term in Odia. I thought that my
handicap in Odia stems from the fact that I am not a native speaker of Odia 
but learnt the language as I had schooling in Odisha. However, it appears there
are inherent problem with language being derived from Sanskrit. Sanskrit is 
definitely more developed and richer language compared to English or even Latin
or Franco-Greek Languages. But no one uses Sanskrit or Latin for technical 
education except for translation.
