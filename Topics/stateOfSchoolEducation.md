## Challenges in Increasing GER of Higher Education

The prominent tribal leader Birsa Munda's birth anniversary falls on 15th November. He was a freedom fighter and a leader of a mass religious 
movement in the late 19th century. The airport at Ranchi is named after him. For more details about Birsa Munda, the readers may refer to the 
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birsa_Munda). Jharkhand state was inaugurated on 15th November 2000 
to coincide with Birsa Munda's birth anniversary. It was carved out of Santhal Parganas and Chhotnagpur divisions of the then southern Bihar 
through the Bihar State Reorganization bill. 


Recently, during random browsing of youtube channels,  I came across a video on the state of primary and middle school education in Jharkhand. Most
probably, the location of the school is somewhere in Palamau District. The footage reveals the abject state of primary and middle school education in Jharkhand. 
The anchor presents the video in a local dialect of Hindi, which is difficult to comprehend in every detail. However, the video provides ample evidence of
the state's apathy toward primary and secondary education even after 75 years of India's independence.


Let me first dwell a bit on the video before focusing on the issues it brings out. The school featured in the 
video is a govt run middle school. It had an enrollment of 450, according to the school coordinator. The school employs 
four teachers against a sanctioned strength of eight. About 120 students are registered for class 8, but the classroom capacity is
hardly 60. According to a class teacher, only about 40-45 students attend the school on any day. The building and infrastructure are in an
abysmal state. The classroom is cluttered with rickety benches and tables, leaving no movement space. Both daylight and 
ventilation are poor in the room. However, infrastructure is more of a resource problem. The state's ministry of education can quickly solve 
it by a one-time act. The bigger problem is the poor training that the kids are getting in school.

Out of 45 odd students, only one can successfully name the subjects in the syllabus for class 8. When asked about maths, 
one student told the anchor that he could do up to 30. The anchor assumed that the student had memorized tables for numbers 
up to 30. The anchor wanted to double-check and asked the student to recite the table of 5. Then the student clarified he 
could only count up to 30! No student could correctly spell the names of months in a calendar. After erasing the month name 
three times, the teacher misspelled February. One of the smarter kids in the class corrected the spelling. She
incidentally could spell the word "science" correctly both in English and in Hindi. The rest of the students in the class could not even spell Vigyan (in Hindi).

The purpose of giving a brief description of the video is not to denigrate the school but 
to understand the issues in the management of school education and the apathy of the state govt to create a solid foundation 
for higher and technical education in the state. I believe most government-run schools are in similar 
conditions across the country. Especially those located in villages and small semi-urban settlements in India. The primary issues that the 
video brings out are as follows:

- The teachers are untrained, and there is hardly any knowledge gap between the teacher and the taught.
- Education is the last welfare priority for the party in power.
- The govt spending on schooling is non-existent or extremely low.
- Societal awareness about school education is lacking among the people, especially in underdeveloped states.

Politicians across parties are either apathetic or too scared to self-empower people by providing a decent education system.
They depend only on giving out freebies for winning the election and capturing power. People must realize that there is "no free lunch." 
If people rely only on freebies, it only creates a nation of beggars and homeless destitute. 

India has roughly 1k universities with 40k affiliated colleges. In 2019-20, the GER (Gross Enrollment Ratio) was 27.1. It 
translates to approximately 3.7 corers enrollments for the population in the age group of 18-23 years. A group of 
experts headed by the UGC vice-chairperson suggested that EER (Eligibility Enrollment Ratio) is more appropriate 
than GER. EER refers to the ratio of the eligible population. I see it as an indirect admission of India's poor primary
and school education system. Ineligibility of enrollment for higher education is due to heavy dropouts at school levels.
The suggestion to use EER is a subterfuge to avoid criticism that not all is "honky dory" in the state education system. The 
report mentions GERs of 10 different nations, including the US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, China, Indonesia, South Africa, 
and Pakistan. Understandably only South Africa and Pakistan have lower GER than India. China at 49.1% and Brazil at 51.3% 
GER is way ahead of India. The rest of the nations have GER over 60%, with the US leading at 88.2%.

Recently, the Government of India appointed Prof M. Jagadish as the new chairperson of UGC. He was vice-chancellor of JNU and had served as a professor at IIT 
Delhi. He brings in considerable experience both as an academic administrator and an educator. I believe he understands and 
realizes the situation more than anyone else in the Govt. However, I guess his task won't be easy, given the state of the country's 
primary and secondary education. Pulling up GER would be a "Herculean Harakiri" unless the state governments cooperate. Education 
is a concurrent subject under the constitution. It allows states to legislate and control the education sector in a state. Though 
having uniformity in education across India is undesirable, I believe the "Knowledge Quotient" (KQ) is an important issue. 
By KQ, I refer to an intrinsic understanding of the subject rather than specifics. However, in technical education, KQ 
should be uniform across the country. It is perhaps the reason for the low success rate of aspirants from some areas of the country in any 
common tests such as JEE, Advance JEE, NEET, GATE, and CLAT. It is high time that, as a nation, we realize the need for foundational changes in the 
school education system.
