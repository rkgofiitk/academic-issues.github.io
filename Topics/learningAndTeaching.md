# Learning and Teaching

This blog is inspired by a podcast by Ranveer Allahbadia. I came across the podcast while randomly browsing youtube channels.
It is revealing that some of the young people are into podcast absolutely apolitical social issues. The guest in podcast
considers that the education system worldwide is designed to help teachers. According to him neither the faculty at Indian 
institutions like IITs, IISc or IIM nor those in famous US Ivy League institutions make in difference in learning. 
The guest Mr Pratham Mittal ascribe the real reason for the success of the students of an 
institution is purely on the filtering system for selection of students at Ivy League of institutions or the IITs, IISc or 
IIMs. He also talked about the JEE equivalent entrance examination "Gaokao" which prestigeous Chinese institutions of higer 
learning use. The guest concedes that there may be a few good teachers who may make a difference in learning. However, class 
room lectures only reaches a few students sitting in front benches. Most students in back benches only nod in pretence of
understanding or being attentive to lectures. The students mostly watch youtube videos and engage in self-learning. Colleges 
are for earning a degrees that help the learners to become street smarts. A large peer group in a good institutions help the
students become street-smart. 

There is always an appreciable gap between theory and implementation. It may be due to resources and raw material used for an
implementation. Therefore, hands-on learning is absolutely necessary for skill development. It is the skill and skill alone which 
fetches a good placement. Gurkul system of education in the days of Nalanda, Takshilla or Vikramshilla were purely based on
hands-on learning. Every single guru was responsible only a few disciples. A guru would share his experience and his disciples 
learn those only through practice, no books were available at that time. However, it is not quite possible given that even an
institution like IITs admit close to 1.5k students every year. Books are repositories of knowledge that helped teachers to 
structure their lectures in a systematic way for a large student audience. In the intregnum between youtube and the books, 
the students were attending classroom lectures. It helped them understand the nuances of applying theory to practice. However, 
now with webinars and youtube videos, there is no need to attend classroom lectures. That is exactly what one of my students
told me a few years back when I asked him the reasons for not attending the class. None-the-less, when choosing a guide for
his major project he preferred to join me, attended regular meetings, and did a decent job. So, big class size could be a
dampner for many students.

It is true that books are resources from where teachers source teach material. However, a lot of efforts is needed to make these
material in a form that an average learner in the classroom may find easy to understand. What teachers these days find problematic
is to evaluate home assignments. About 40% of students who submit assignments directly lift from available sources in the Internet.
With ChatGPT and other clones, it has become yet more easier. One professor shared an interesting experience with a student. 
The student met the professor and sought clues for solving the home assignment problem. The professor explained the approach 
using 2-3 examples without giving clues for other test cases. The student used ChatGPT and put questions from his discussion
with the professor and generated a solution. The solution was exactly adequate for 2-3 cases. On querying the student it was
found that the student did not even bother to check the ChatGPT answer. He just resorted to copy and paste and submitted the
ChatGPT solution. I do not think it is a teacher's responsibility to peform the job of policing the students against cheating.
We used a variety of technique to find cheating in programming assignments using Mosh, Turnitin, etc. ChatGPT and its clones
have made cheating so much easier these days. I believe learning is a two-way responsibility between teacher and taught. Our
system of education needs a drastic out-of-the-box approach. Perhaps, hands-on is still very essential. However, understanding
theory could be left to student altogether. They can access the knowledge base over the Internet.

How is knowledge-base important? From grading and assessment point of view having a knowledge-base is critical. Additionally, 
it does help though a degree from a prestigeous institute is the real icing on the cake that fetches a good placement. That
is a perception even the most parents of kids share. The parents measure the success of an institution by the salary packages that
their wards are able to secure after graduation. Wherever there is an emphasis on hands-on learning, students acquire skills 
for innovations. However, rote learning also has a place. Rote learning equips students with a content-addressable, in-memory 
knowledge base. A right mix of rote-learning and hands-on makes a person enormously successful. Indian education system puts
a lot of emphasis in rote-learning. Our exam methodology largely designed to test ability to memorize things. That may be the
reason why even CEOs of Google and MSN are Indians. Many of my old students are now established entreprenauers.
