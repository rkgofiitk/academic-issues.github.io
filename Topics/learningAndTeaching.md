# Learning and Teaching

A podcast I watched on youtube inspires this blog. It reveals that entrepreneurial efforts may succeed even with podcasts on 
apolitical social issues like education and learning. The podcast guest gave an interesting theory that the design of the
education system worldwide is to help teachers. He opined neither the faculty at elite Indian institutions like IITs, IISc, or 
IIM nor those in US Ivy League institutions make in difference in learning. The guest ascribes the real reason for the success 
of the students of an institution is purely the filtering system for admission stage. He also talked about the JEE equivalent 
entrance examination, "Gaokao," which prestigious Chinese institutions of higher 
learning use. The guest concedes that a few good teachers may make a difference in learning. However, classroom lectures only reach a few students sitting on the front benches. Most students in the back benches only nod in the pretense of
understanding or being attentive to lectures. The students mostly watch youtube videos and engage in self-learning. Colleges 
are for earning degrees that help learners to become street smarts by interacting with peer groups. A large peer group
in a good institution helps the students become street-smart. 

There is always a palpable gap between theory and implementation. It may be due to the availability of resources for 
implementation. Therefore, hands-on learning is necessary for skill development. It is the skill and skill alone which 
fetches a suitable placement. The Gurukul education system in the days of Nalanda, Takshilla, or Vikramshilla was purely based on
hands-on learning. Every single guru was responsible for only a few disciples. A guru would share his experience, and his disciples 
learn those only through practice. No books were available at that time. However, it is impossible, given that even an
institution like IIT admits close to 1.5k students yearly. Books are repositories of knowledge that help teachers structure their lectures systematically for a large student audience. 
Attending classroom lectures helps them understand the nuances of applying theory to practice. However, 
webinars and youtube videos have made classroom lectures redundant and a waste of time. That is what I 
understood one of my students told me a few years as the reasons for not attending the class. Nonetheless, when 
choosing a guide for his major project, he preferred to join me, attended regular meetings, and did a decent job. It 
emphasizes the need for a hands-on approach to learning. A big class size, where the teacher delivers lectures for a median
student, could be more effective for both ends of the spectrum of student assimilation abilities.

Books are indeed resources from which teachers source to teach the material. However, a lot of effort is needed to make these materials in a form that an average learner in the classroom may find easy to understand. What teachers these days find problematic
is evaluating home assignments. About 40% of students who submit assignments directly lift solutions from available sources on
the Internet. With ChatGPT and its clones, it has become yet more easier. One professor shared an interesting case of cheating by
a student. The student met the professor and sought clues for solving the home assignment problem. The professor explained the approach 
using 2-3 examples without giving clues for other test cases. The student used ChatGPT and put questions from his discussion
with the professor. ChatGPT generated a solution adequate for 2-3 cases the professor discussed with the
student. On querying, the student admitted to copying the ChatGPT solution without checking whether it could
handle other corner cases. However, it is not a teacher's responsibility to perform the job of policing the students
against cheating. We used various techniques to find cheating in programming assignments using Mosh, Turnitin, etc. ChatGPT 
has made cheating much easier these days. Learning is a two-way responsibility between the teacher and taught. Our
system of education needs a drastic, out-of-the-box approach. Hands-on is still very essential. The understanding
theory could be left to the student altogether or discussed by the teacher on a need basis. The student can access the knowledge-base
over the Internet. However, hands-on learning can work in a small class size. A teacher-taught ratio of 1:10 may be adequate. 

Grading and evaluation are still primarily dependent on written exams. Therefore, success in exams is proportional to a student's 
retention ability. A degree from a prestigious institute can be considered icing on the cake that fetches 
a suitable placement. That is a perception even most parents of kids share. The parents measure the success of their wards by
the salary packages they can get. Wherever there is an emphasis on hands-on learning, students acquire innovation skills. However, rote learning also has a place. Rote learning equips students with a content-addressable, in-memory 
knowledge base. The right mix of rote learning and hands-on contributes to a person's success. Indian education system puts
a lot of emphasis on rote learning. Our exam methodology is primarily designed to test the ability to memorize things. That may be why even CEOs of Google and MSN are Indians. Many of my old students are now established entrepreneurs.  

The underlying thread of discussion is limited to the country's technical education system. However, about 85-90% of the students
who continue their studies after schools have to go for undergraduate education in liberal arts. Science and commerce. Only 0.1% of 
these graduates barely manage a salary package of 5lacs PA. The remaining 99.99% are unemployable. Even out of 15lac technical
graduates (which include engineering, fashion designers, architecture, mass communication, etc.), at most 1-1.5 lac get 
jobs. The remaining 90% are unemployable. The country's growth is, therefore, held back by unemployable youths. 

Over 40% of the country's workforce belongs to the agriculture sector. However, this sector remains archaic and accounts for a large share of
the unorganized labor force. I am unable to understand why the government withdrew firm laws. The court also erred in saying that no farmers supported the law as they did not approach the court. I wish government should have handled 
the agitation more professionally. Reforms in the agriculture sector will give impetus to accelerated growth. The aim of reaching
a five trillion dollar economy cannot come out of a vacuum. The other industry in which the government is investing 
a lot is manufacturing. Indeed, the manufacturing sector contributes heavily to growth. But overall growth will remain
uneven if the agriculture sector does not undergo sufficient reforms. We should reduce the dependence on the agriculture sector
by mechanization and rebalancing, firming the output of cash crops and food crops. Startups in agriculture should be encouraged.

Small vendors include ubiquitous Kirana and pharmacy stores and street hawkers. Any urban center in India constitutes
a sizeable number of these self-styled entrepreneurs. Estimated 1-1.5 lac in Kolkata and 2-2.5 lacs in Mumbai, street hawkers
deal with anything and everything starting from electronics, mobile accessories, garments, clothes, threads and needles, cosmetics,
vegetables, fruits, pan, chai, chat, pau bhaji. India's informal economy contributes about 15-20% of GDP. They are vital to supply-
chain for the urban poor. In a sense, it represents the country's entrepreneurial capabilities. The skill requirements to absorb
these self-style entrepreneurs into formal sectors could be challenging for urban planners and policymakers if 
they integrate and harness their entrepreneurial capabilities.


Most of 
unemployable youths are frustrated though they possibly need help understanding their ill-preparedness for a job. The education system
let them down. It leads to political manipulations of the worst kind. People are fragmented to take a united stand against 
politicians. Unless we create a situation where education gives a sense of empowerment, the living conditions of people will 
not improve, and the nation as a polity will remain impoverished and open to political manipulations.
