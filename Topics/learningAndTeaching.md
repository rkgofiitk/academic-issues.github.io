# Learning and Teaching

[Blog Index](../index.md)

The mainstream television channels in India are obsessed with politics and irrelevant talk shows, which creates a narrative that
India is all about hatred, religious bigotry, and crimes. They hardly ever bring social issues to public attention. It is, 
therefore, heartening that many serious content creators are turning to podcasts for highlighting apolitical social issues like 
education and learning. Recently, I watched one podcast where the guest gave an interesting theory that the design of the 
education system worldwide is to help teachers rather than students. He opines 
neither the faculty at elite US Ivy League institutions like Harvard nor those in Indian institutions like IITs, IISc, or IIM 
make much difference in the learning and education of students. The guest ascribes the success of the students of an institution to 
the robust filtering system at the admission stage. He also spoke about China, where the best institutions 
use "Gaokao" to filter talent recruitment at the admission stage. "Gaokao" is the JEE equivalent entrance test
in China. The guest concedes that a few good teachers may make a difference in learning. However, classroom lectures are mostly
uninspiring as they target the median of the student composition in a class. It does little to inspire exceptionally
talented students or slow learners. Students these days mostly watch youtube videos and engage in self-learning. Admissions
to good colleges serve two purposes, namely, (i) to earn degrees and (ii) to help the students to become street smarts. 
Opportunity to interact with a talented peer group encounter challenges in acquiring skills to be street-smart and 
better prepared as potential recruiters. 

There is always a yawning gap between theory and implementation. It may be due to the availability of resources for 
implementation, while theory is generic and fails to include unforeseen real-life, unforeseen constraints. Therefore, 
hands-on learning is necessary for skill development. The skill and skill alone  
fetches a good placement or brings success in life. The Gurukul education system in the days of Nalanda, Takshilla, or 
Vikramshilla was purely based on hands-on learning. Every guru had a unique pedagogic style
and was responsible for only a few disciples (students). A guru would share his experience, and his disciples 
learn the survival tricks only through practice. No books were available at that time. However, hands-on teaching is
impossible because even an institution like IIT admits close to 1.5k students yearly. Books are repositories of knowledge 
that help teachers structure their lectures systematically for a large student audience. 
Attending classroom lectures helps them understand the nuances of applying theory to practice. However, 
webinars and youtube videos have made classroom lectures almost redundant and a waste of time. One of my students told
me the same a few years ago. Nonetheless, the same student preferred to join me when 
choosing a guide for his major project. He attended regular meetings and did a decent 
job on the project. It emphasizes the need for a hands-on approach to learning. A big class size, where the teacher delivers 
lectures for a median student, hoping it could serve the abilities to assimilate for both ends of the student spectrum. 
Though books are indeed resources from which teachers source to teach the material, a lot of effort is needed 
to make these materials in a form that an average learner in the classroom may find easy to understand. So, a teacher's
job is to create a rendition of a book to lecture material. 

An entirely new problem that teachers these days find problematic is in evaluating home assignments. About 40% of students 
who submit assignments directly lift solutions from available sources on the Internet. With ChatGPT and its clones, it has 
become yet more easier. One professor shared an interesting case of cheating by a student. The student met the professor and 
sought clues for solving the home assignment problem. The professor explained the approach using 2-3 examples without giving
clues for other corner cases. The student used ChatGPT and put questions from his discussion
with the professor. ChatGPT generated a solution applicable to 2-3 cases the professor discussed with the
student. On querying, the student admitted to copying the ChatGPT solution without checking whether it could
handle other corner cases. However, policing students against cheating is not a teacher's responsibility. We use
various techniques to find cheating in programming assignments using Mosh, Turnitin, etc. Learning is a two-way 
responsibility between the teacher and taught. Our system of education needs a drastic, out-of-the-box approach. Hands-on is 
still very essential. The understanding theory could be left to the student altogether or discussed by the teacher on a need 
basis. The student can access the knowledge base over the Internet. However, hands-on learning can work in small class sizes.
A teacher-taught ratio of 1:10 may be adequate. We need to trim down unnecessary heavy theoretical materials from syllabi.

Grading and evaluation are still primarily dependent on written exams. Therefore, success in exams is proportional to a student's 
retention ability. The parents measure the success of their wards by
the salary packages they can get. Wherever there is an emphasis on hands-on learning, students acquire innovation skills. 
However, rote learning also has a place. It equips students with a content-addressable, in-memory knowledge base. The right mix
of rote learning and hands-on contributes to a person's success. Indian education system puts
a lot of emphasis on rote learning. Our exam methodology is primarily designed to test the ability to memorize things. However,
rote learning is inadequate for a person's ability to innovate and handle unforeseen situations. Learning through
experimentation is essential for innovations and inventions. At IITs, faculty members have some liberties to create their
evaluation system through home assignments, quizzes, term papers, take-home exams, seminars, etc. The students 
go through a regular evaluation system without feeling the pressure of memorizing everything.

So far, the discussion thread has been restricted to the technical education system. However, about 85-90% of the students
who continue their studies after schools have to go for undergraduate education in Science, Liberal arts, or Commerce. 
Approximately 0.1% of these non-technical undergraduates barely manage a salary package of 5lacs PA. The remaining 99.99% 
are unemployable. Even out of 15lac technical graduates (which include engineering, fashion designers, architecture, mass 
communication, etc.), at most 1-1.5 lac get jobs. The remaining 90% are unemployable. Therefore, the country's growth is 
held back by a generation of unemployable youths. State governments control the majority of our universities. 
Unfortunately, state governments are the biggest culprits in messing with the education system. Rampant politicization has 
turned universities into islands of criminal elements. None of the state governments ever implemented Lyndoh's recommendations on the election of student union representatives. Funds for universities were reduced drastically. Pliant, incompetent, and
unqualified persons were placed as VCs to further the state ruling party's agenda.

Over 40% of the country's largely unorganized workforce belongs to the agriculture sector. However, this sector remains archaic. 
I am unable to understand why the government withdrew firm laws. The highest court erred in saying that no farmers supported the
law as they did not approach the court. I wish government should have handled 
the agitation more professionally. Reforms in the agriculture sector will give impetus to accelerated growth. The aim of reaching
a five trillion dollar economy cannot come out of a vacuum. The other industry in which the government is investing 
a lot is manufacturing. Indeed, the manufacturing sector contributes heavily to growth. But overall growth will remain
uneven if the agriculture sector does not undergo sufficient reforms. Committing a large workforce to the agriculture sector
is counter-productive to accelerated growth. We should reduce the dependence on the agriculture sector by mechanization and 
rebalancing, firming the output of cash crops and food crops. Startups in agriculture should be encouraged. I am sure govt 
is working on it. However, a country where policies are determined more from the point of view of winning an election leads to 
misinformation campaigns of the worst kind. It has made it easier for vested interest groups to have policy interferences. There is 
no easy solution to these problems unless real fact-checking is done quickly and regularly. 

Indians have the natural talent to become entrepreneurs. Small-time vendors managing ubiquitous Kirana stores, pharmacy stores, and 
restaurants  represent the entrepreneurial skills of Indians. Any urban center in India constitutes a sizeable number of street 
hawkers who deal with anything and everything, including electronics, mobile accessories, garments, clothes, threads and needles, 
cosmetics, vegetables, fruits, pan, chai, chat, and "pau bhaji." India's informal economy contributes about 15-20% of GDP. They are 
vital to the supply chain to reach end users. The skill requirements to absorb
these self-styled entrepreneurs into formal sectors could be challenging for urban planners and policymakers. A conservative 
estimate tells about 1-1.5 lac street hawkers operate in Kolkata and 2-2.5 lacs in Mumbai. Govts have experimented with cooperative 
societies for the collective upscaling of these people. However, the cooperative movement has only succeeded a little, except in 
milk collection and microfinancing. It is time that policymakers discover innovative solutions to the collective upscaling of 
people engaged in informal sectors.

Another issue that should bother the govt is the training of administrators. Britishers left us with a framework of administration 
managed by the IAS cadre officers. That British administrative legacy is woefully inadequate for new India's challenges and 
perhaps contributed to large-scale institutionalized corruption. The effectiveness of bureaucracy can be judged from the fact that
only a few lacs of Britishers could control the entire population of India (roughly 35 corers) through these administrators. 
IAS officers were trained to think and dress like colonial rulers and hate the natives like Britishers. Decolonization of the Indian
Administrative Service should be done immediately.

Most unemployable youths are frustrated though they may need help understanding their ill-preparedness for a job. 
The education system let them down. Unless we create a situation where education gives a sense of empowerment, the living 
conditions of people will not improve, and the nation as a polity will remain impoverished and open to political manipulations. 
I think there is a need to have a code of conduct for good politics and an urgent need to debar criminal elements completely. 
Our justice system also needs decolonization. Courts have contributed little in terms of policy correction. The
court's intervention is primarily passive and sometimes flawed and defied logic. We need a complete revamping of legal
jurisprudence right from the legal education system.
