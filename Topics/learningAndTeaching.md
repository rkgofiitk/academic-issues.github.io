# Learning and Teaching

This blog is inspired by a podcast by Ranveer Allahbadia. I came across the podcast while randomly browsing youtube channels.
It is revealing that some of the young people are into podcast absolutely apolitical social issues. The guest in podcast
considers that the education system worldwide is designed to help teachers. According to him neither the faculty at Indian 
institutions like IITs, IISc or IIM nor those in famous US Ivy League institutions make in difference in learning. 
The guest Mr Pratham Mittal ascribe the real reason for the success of the students of an 
institution is purely on the filtering system for selection of students at Ivy League of institutions or the IITs, IISc or 
IIMs. He also talked about the JEE equivalent entrance examination "Gaokao" which prestigeous Chinese institutions of higer 
learning use. The guest concedes that there may be a few good teachers who may make a difference in learning. However, class 
room lectures only reaches a few students sitting in front benches. Most students in back benches only nod in pretence of
understanding or being attentive to lectures. The students mostly watch youtube videos and engage in self-learning. Colleges 
are for earning a degrees that help the learners to become street smarts. A large peer group in a good institutions help the
students become street-smart. 

There is always an appreciable gap between theory and implementation. It may be due to resources and raw material used for an
implementation. Therefore, hands-on learning is absolutely necessary for skill development. It is the skill and skill alone which 
fetches a good placement. Gurkul system of education in the days of Nalanda, Takshilla or Vikramshilla were purely based on
hands-on learning. Every single guru was responsible only a few disciples. A guru would share his experience and his disciples 
learn those only through practice, no books were available at that time. However, it is not quite possible given that even an
institution like IITs admit close to 1.5k students every year. Books are repositories of knowledge that helped teachers to 
structure their lectures in a systematic way for a large student audience. In the intregnum between youtube and the books, 
the students were attending classroom lectures. It helped them understand the nuances of applying theory to practice. However, 
now with webinars and youtube videos, there is no need to attend classroom lectures. That is exactly what one of my students
told me a few years back when I asked him the reasons for not attending the class. None-the-less, when choosing a guide for
his major project he preferred to join me, attended regular meetings, and did a decent job. So, big class size could be a
dampner for many students.

It is true that books are resources from where teachers source teach material. However, a lot of efforts is needed to make these
material in a form that an average learner in the classroom may find easy to understand. What teachers these days find problematic
is to evaluate home assignments. About 40% of students who submit assignments directly lift solutions from available sources in
the Internet. With ChatGPT and its clones, it has become yet more easier. One professor shared an interesting case of cheating by
a student. The student met the professor and sought clues for solving the home assignment problem. The professor explained the approach 
using 2-3 examples without giving clues for other test cases. The student used ChatGPT and put questions from his discussion
with the professor. ChatGPT generated a solution exactly adequate for 2-3 cases which the professor discussed with the
student. On querying, the student admitted that he copied generated solution without bothering to check whether it was able to
handle other corner cases. However, I do not think it is a teacher's responsibility to peform the job of policing the students
against cheating. We used a variety of technique to find cheating in programming assignments using Mosh, Turnitin, etc. ChatGPT 
has made cheating much easier these days. I believe learning is a two-way responsibility between teacher and taught. Our
system of education needs a drastic out-of-the-box approach. Perhaps, hands-on is still very essential. Understanding
theory could be left to student altogether or discussed by the teacher on a need-basis. The student can access the knowledge-base
over the Internet. However, hand-on learning can work in a small class size. A teacher taught ratio of 1:10 may be just adequate. 

Grading and evaluation are still mostly dependent on written exams. Therefore, the success in exams are proportional to a student's 
retention ability. A degree from a prestigeous institute can be considered as icing on the cake that fetches 
a good placement. That is a perception even the most parents of kids share. The parents measure the success of their wards by
the salary packages that they are able to get. Wherever there is an emphasis on hands-on learning, students acquire skills 
for innovations. However, rote learning also has a place. Rote learning equips students with a content-addressable, in-memory 
knowledge base. A right mix of rote-learning and hands-on contribute to a person's success. Indian education system puts
a lot of emphasis in rote-learning. Our exam methodology largely designed to test ability to memorize things. That may be the
reason why even CEOs of Google and MSN are Indians. Many of my old students are now established entreprenauers.  

The underlying thread of discussion is limited to technical education system of the country. However, about 85-90% of the students
who continue studies after schools have to go for undergraduate education in liberal arts. Only 0.1% of such graduates are barely 
able to manage a salary package 5lacs PA. The remaining 99.99% are unemployable. Story is not any different for technical graduates, 
about 5-8% manage to get placements, the remaining 95-92% are unemployable. The country's growth is, therefore, held back by 
unemployable youths which creates crimes and social unrests. It leads to political manipulations of worst kind. Unless we create
a situation where education gives a sense of empowerment, the living conditions of people will not improve.
