# Learning and Teaching

Mainstream television channels in India are obssessed with politics and irrelevant talk shows which creates a narrative that
Inida is all about hatred, religious bigtory, and crimes. They hardly ever bring social issues to public attentions. It is, 
therefore, heartening that many serious content creators are turning to podcasts on apolitical social issues like 
education and learning. Some of these podcasts are thought proving. Recently, I watched a podcast where the guest gave 
an interesting theory that the design of the education system worldwide is to help teachers rather than students. He opines 
neither the faculty at elite Indian institutions like IITs, IISc, or IIM nor those in US Ivy League institutions make much
difference in learning or educating students. The guest ascribes the success of the students of an institution to the robust
filtering system at the admission stage. He argues that the best talents from China also originate from institutions that 
use "Gaokao" for the admission stage. "Gaokao" happens to be the JEE equivalent entrance test in China. The guest concedes 
that a few good teachers may make a difference in learning. However, classroom lectures are mostly uninspiring as they
are targeted for median of the student composition of a class. Students these days mostly watch youtube videos and 
engage in self-learning. Admissions to good colleges are preferred for earning degrees and help the learners to become street smarts 
by interacting with peer groups. A large peer group in a good institution poses immense challenges to the students in acquiring
skills to be more street-smart and better prepared for success in jobs. 

There is always a yawning gap between theory and implementation. It may be due to the availability of resources for 
implementation, while theory is generic and fails to include unforeseen real-life constraints. Therefore, hands-on learning
is necessary for skill development. It is the skill and skill alone which 
fetches a suitable placement. The Gurukul education system in the days of Nalanda, Takshilla, or Vikramshilla was purely based on
hands-on learning. Every single guru was responsible for only a few disciples. A guru would share his experience, and his disciples 
learn those only through practice. No books were available at that time. However, it is impossible, given that even an
institution like IIT admits close to 1.5k students yearly. Books are repositories of knowledge that help teachers structure 
their lectures systematically for a large student audience. 
Attending classroom lectures helps them understand the nuances of applying theory to practice. However, 
webinars and youtube videos have made classroom lectures almost redundant and a waste of time. One of my students told
me the same a few years. Nonetheless, the same student preferred to join me when 
choosing a guide for his major project. He attended regular meetings and did a decent 
job on the project. It emphasizes the need for a hands-on approach to learning. A big class size, where the teacher delivers 
lectures for a median student, hoping it could be more effective for both ends of the spectrum of student abilities
for assimilation. Though books are indeed resources from which teachers source to teach the material, a lot of effort is needed 
to make these materials in a form that an average learner in the classroom may find easy to understand. 

An entirely new problem that teachers these days find problematic is in evaluating home assignments. About 40% of students 
who submit assignments directly lift solutions from available sources on the Internet. With ChatGPT and its clones, it has 
become yet more easier. One professor shared an interesting case of cheating by a student. The student met the professor and 
sought clues for solving the home assignment problem. The professor explained the approach using 2-3 examples without giving
clues for other corner cases. The student used ChatGPT and put questions from his discussion
with the professor. ChatGPT generated a solution applicable to 2-3 cases the professor discussed with the
student. On querying, the student admitted to copying the ChatGPT solution without checking whether it could
handle other corner cases. However, policing students against cheating is not a teacher's responsibility. We use
various techniques to find cheating in programming assignments using Mosh, Turnitin, etc. Learning is a two-way 
responsibility between the teacher and taught. Our system of education needs a drastic, out-of-the-box approach. Hands-on is 
still very essential. The understanding theory could be left to the student altogether or discussed by the teacher on a need 
basis. The student can access the knowledge base over the Internet. However, hands-on learning can work in a small class size.
A teacher-taught ratio of 1:10 may be adequate. We need to trim down unnecessary heavy theoretical materials from syllabi.

Grading and evaluation are still primarily dependent on written exams. Therefore, success in exams is proportional to a student's 
retention ability. The parents measure the success of their wards by
the salary packages they can get. Wherever there is an emphasis on hands-on learning, students acquire innovation skills. 
However, rote learning also has a place. Rote learning equips students with a content-addressable, in-memory 
knowledge base. The right mix of rote learning and hands-on contributes to a person's success. Indian education system puts
a lot of emphasis on rote learning. Our exam methodology is primarily designed to test the ability to memorize things. That may 
be why even CEOs of Google and MSN are Indians. Many of my old students are now established entrepreneurs.  

The underlying discussion thread is limited to the country's technical education system. However, about 85-90% of the students
who continue their studies after schools have to go for undergraduate education in liberal arts. Science and Commerce. Only 0.1% of 
these graduates barely manage a salary package of 5lacs PA. The remaining 99.99% are unemployable. Even out of 15lac technical
graduates (which include engineering, fashion designers, architecture, mass communication, etc.), at most 1-1.5 lac get 
jobs. The remaining 90% are unemployable. The country's growth is, therefore, held back by unemployable youths. 

Over 40% of the country's workforce belongs to the agriculture sector. However, this sector remains archaic and accounts for a 
large share of the unorganized labor force. I am unable to understand why the government withdrew firm laws. The highest court 
erred in saying that no farmers supported the law as they did not approach the court. I wish government should have handled 
the agitation more professionally. Reforms in the agriculture sector will give impetus to accelerated growth. The aim of reaching
a five trillion dollar economy cannot come out of a vacuum. The other industry in which the government is investing 
a lot is manufacturing. Indeed, the manufacturing sector contributes heavily to growth. But overall growth will remain
uneven if the agriculture sector does not undergo sufficient reforms and reliance on the agriculture sector is brought down. We 
should reduce the dependence on the agriculture sector by mechanization and rebalancing, firming the output of cash crops and 
food crops. Startups in agriculture should be encouraged. I am sure govt is working on it. However, policies are determined
more from the point of view of election. Dissemination of misinformation  has made it difficult to block policy
interferences by vested interest groups. There is no easy solution to these problems unless real fact-checking is
done quickly and regularly. 

Indians have the natural talent to become entrepreneurs. Small-time vendors managing ubiquitous kirana stores, pharmacy stores, and 
restaurants  represent the entrepreneurial skills of Indians. Any urban center in India constitutes a sizeable number of street 
hawkers who deal with anything and everything, including electronics, mobile accessories, garments, clothes, threads and needles, 
cosmetics, vegetables, fruits, pan, chai, chat, and "pau bhaji." India's informal economy contributes about 15-20% of GDP. They are 
vital to supply-chain for the urban poor. The skill requirements to absorb
these self-styled entrepreneurs into formal sectors could be challenging for urban planners and policymakers. A conservative 
estimate tells about 1-1.5 lac street hawkers operate in Kolkata and 2-2.5 lacs in Mumbai. Govts have experimented with cooperative 
societies for the collective upscaling of these people. However, the cooperative movement has only succeeded a little, except in 
milk collection and microfinancing. It is time that policymakers discover innovative solutions to the collective upscaling of 
people engaged in informal sectors.

Another issue that should bother the govt is the training of administrators. Britishers left us with a framework of administration 
managed by the IAS cadre. That British administrative legacy is woefully inadequate for new India's challenges. A few lacs of 
Britishers could control the entire population of India (roughly 35 corers) through these administrators. IAS officers were 
trained to think and dress like colonial rulers and hate the natives like Britishers. Decolonization of the Indian
Administrative Service should be done immediately.

Most unemployable youths are frustrated though they may need help understanding their ill-preparedness for a job. 
The education system let them down. It leads to political manipulations of the worst kind. People are fragmented to take a 
united stand against politicians. Unless we create a situation where education gives a sense of empowerment, the living 
conditions of people will not improve, and the nation as a polity will remain impoverished and open to political manipulations. 
I think there is a need to have a code of conduct for good politics and an urgent need to debar criminal elements completely.
