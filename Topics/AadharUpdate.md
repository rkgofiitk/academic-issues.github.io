# Adhar Ecosystem and Citizens' Ordeal

This short article addresses a serious concern about the usability of the Aadhar Ecosystem, which the Govt of India and all financial institutions, including banks, are aggressively
pushing. The population of India is going to cross or has already crossed the population of China. The number is proving to be a nightmare for back-end engineers and legacy administrative staff who must learn about handling the massive numbers. Aadhar architecture appears to be more monolithic 
than it should have been. The handlers want to keep everything under wraps, including technical aspects of Aadhar. Even if you have a 1Gbps link, 
you will only download an Aadhar card as a citizen if you have tried three times. Captcha won't work, OTP will not be delivered, then OTP will not
match. It is a really complex user interface. Aadhar back-end appears to need more support in distributed Content Delivery Networks or 
Geolocated servers. Otherwise, the problem in downloading Aadhar cards will remain as it is now. We know both Google and Microsoft run worldwide end-user services that work well. All social network sites work like magic. Everyone is using two-factor authentication these days. Aadhar is no different. Then why is Aadhar so difficult to access? Can the Aadhar CEO give a satisfactory response? He won't even care to 
respond. 

Having dealt with the user interface issue, let me turn to the serious back-end issue I am experiencing now. Let me lay out the problem details before telling what a catastrophic Aadhar blunder could be.

<ul>
  <li>I submitted an online request for address update on 15th October, 2022</li>
  <li>The address update was okayed, and my Aadhar card was printed on October 27, 2022, </li>
  <li>I received the card in 1st week of November 2022.</li>
  <li>Suddenly, the address reverted to the old address, which I noticed only on February 19, 2023, </li>
  <li>I immediately reported the problem to Aadhar through 1947 and emailed to the helpdesk</li>
  <li>No one responded until I started writing emails to customer care and Aadhar officials of New Delhi</li>
  <li>One Mr. Suresh Kumar confirmed the new address over the phone but could not explain why the old address is being displayed.</li>
  <li>I updated my biometric on March 13, 2023, and did not request an address update as I was told by Aadhar officials the new address is in their
    database</li>
</ul>
My real ordeal started from March 13, 2023. The Aadhar official now says that my old address has reverted due to my request for an update. However, 
they conveniently suppress the fact that an address update was never requested on March 13, 2023. According to Aadhar rules, the update takes effect
between 50-90 days. From October 27, 2022, to February 19, 2023, is 114 days (excluding start and end days). So, the question is how the old address 
appeared in the Myaddhar portal after 114 days. I have only two possible answers to it:
<ul>
  <li>Possibly one part of the database may have been wrongly updated by old data</li>
  <li>Someone mischievously updated my data</li>
</ul>
I have no reasons to suspect having a person at the Aadhar back-end who may have a special grudge and was able to identify me from data over 100 crores to
create the mischief. So, the only possible cause is the first one. That is a serious issue because people in that part of the Aadhar database will
realize the problem spread over the years. Only a fraction of these people may have had an update in the intervening period of the data crash. I understand that
officials are smart to realize that and continue to say that because I went for an update on March 13, the system correctly picked the old address.

Now let us grant that my update of March 13 has an address update request. However, as on March 13, 2023, according to Aadhar 
officials, it should be the address of October 27, 2023, and not the address before October 27, 2023. So, it was an idiotic response.
Secondly, as the address block in the update acknowledgment was blank, the Aadhar database should have caught the mistake and flashed an error. However,
as it did not happen, the only possibility is Aadhar enrolment is possible without an address. Ideally, it should have declared me a 
<strong>homeless person</strong>. The officials should admit a mistake as it could create a massive problem of updates.

I remember one previous CEO of Aadhar who once said that a 13-meter-thick concrete wall secures the Aaddhar data server. Unfortunately, having
non-technician management people at the helm will create hell for others. That is how I will describe the Aadhar ecosystem's usability from the 
perspective of ordinary citizens. I must have written over 40 emails and an equal number of tweets to the Customer Relationship Manager, CEO and the
MoIT, and the MosIT between February 19 and the date. So, it is indeed secured by a thick wall literally.
