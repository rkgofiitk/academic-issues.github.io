## International Students Mix at Indian Universities

Only 3.3 lac students from 160 different countries are enrolled at Indian Universities in a period of five years from 2016-2021. In 2019 about 75k chose
India to pursue higher studies. Most students come from Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and very few from Malaysia, Iran, Maldives, Mayanmar, Yemen. 
Compared to this the number of Indian students opting for medical studies in Chinese Universities and Ukrainian Universities is just phenomenal. India
announced new National Education Policy (NEP) in 2021. The NEP is supposed to increase enrollement of foreign studies in India. I think there were about
5-6 students from Bangladesh at IIT Kanpur during early 2000. I know at least 1 or 2 who did not perform well. At that time IIT Kanpur did not have a 
foreign students' cell. Student counseling was not taken seriously. As a result these foreign students were stressed out, and did not know whom to talk to
and share the challenges they faced. After a while I did not see any student from Bangladesh. I also remember having a chat with a student from Bangladesh
who wanted to enroll in a University in Spain. He told me Indian Universities are tough to survive. I am not sure what he meant by saying Indian Universities
are tough. Sometime back NITs had a student exchange program for Nepal. Many Nepalese national use to come to NIT (known as RECs back then). Some of these
students have been very successful.
