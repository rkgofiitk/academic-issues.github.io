## International Students Mix at Indian Universities

About 3.3 lac students from 160 different countries were enrolled at various Indian Universities over five years, from 2016 to 2021. In 2019 about
75k chose India to pursue higher studies. Most international students in India come from Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and 
very few from Malaysia, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, and Yemen. In contrast, the number of Indian students opting for medical studies in Chinese and 
Ukrainian Universities are considerably higher. More than 18000 Indian students were recently evacuated from the Ukraine war zone. About 25K Indian students are 
enrolled in Chinese Universities. Some students from India even go to South Korea and Japan. The problem of student exchange between non-English 
speaking countries is understandably low. However, India and most African countries were under British rule for a long time. So the English language
did influence the higher education system in these countries. But the student exchange program between India and other erstwhile British colonies seems 
low.  Britain could secure a 99-year lease on Hong Kong and trading rights in the ports of Shangai and Canton
following the Opium War, but their influence did not reach mainland China. Deng Xiao Peng understood the importance of the English language as a window for interaction with the world outside China. So, English
was consciously introduced into higher education in China. 

South Korea has realized the importance of English for interaction in technical education. They aggressively scout for English-speaking faculty.
Once I went to Busan for a keynote address at a conference. During a break, the Chair of the dept of a University at Busan offered me 
the position of a visiting professor and wanted to know if I could start immediately. Understandably I was unprepared and did not take the offer.  
I am not sure how the university administration function in South Korea. But in India, according to MHRD rules, we cannot
offer a visiting position to a foreign national without prior approval. At IIT Kanpur, we used to ignore these rules for short-term visits. Luckily
MHRD never objected. However, they could if they wanted to. I believe IIT Kanpur appointed even non-Indian citizens as regular faculty. I am not aware of how it
is done. But apparently, established IITs and IISc can manage to select foreign nationals as regular faculty. So, NEP should be seen as an enabler. 

Most well-known universities worldwide have exchange programs for international students.
India announced a new National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020. The NEP is supposed to increase enrollment in foreign studies in India. It spells out many 
shortcomings of the current education system in India. Notable among these are:

1. Moving towards more multidisciplinary undergraduate education.
2. Allowing faculty and education autonomy
3. Using well-established pedagogic practice for better student experience
4. Reaffirming faculty integrity through honest merit-based evaluation and career progression of faculty based on teaching, research, and service
5. Establishment of a National Research Foundation fund for outstanding peer-reviewed research and actively seeding research in universities and colleges.
Governance of institution by high qualified independent boards having academic.

All the above points were general operating principles of most IITs when they were established on recommendations of the Viceroy's Committee on 
technical education headed by Prof Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. I am also sure that IISc has a forward-looking SoP for admitting international students.
But over the years, the govt of the day tampered with administrative autonomy and sought to place pliable directors and appointed persons of questionable 
credentials as the Chairpersons of IITs. Even some of the educationists who were board chairpersons of different IITs tried to tinker with IITs by
micro-managing through the directors. So, on paper, everything looks fine. Yet things are not conducive to the admittance of international students. No educational institute will ever become immune from external tinkering with or without NEP. There is also an amount of rigidity among educationists, which 
prevented glasnost in engineering education. A class of pseudo academicians likes to do the bidding of the bureaucrats and the politicians
to become Directors and Vice Chancellors. 

The less is said about the state universities, the better it is. The State Universities are under the direct 
control of the state govts, which never allows universities to frame their policies. Odisha, for example, has turned state universities into an extended 
arm of the state education dept.  A couple of vice-chancellors of Utkal and Berhampur Universities left before completing their terms. I am sure that same is 
true about other state govts. While commenting on his premature quitting, the former vice-chancellor of a state university commented that "the bureaucrat 
lackeys of a CM were extending too much affection" in an unofficial private gathering. Officially, the govts may say that the VCs leaving in the middle were
incompetent. But the fact remains that bureaucrats and politicians have pulverized the education system, and the court has done little to dissuade the
interferences. 

At one point in time, Roorkee and BE College Shibpur were very reputed institutions. But both deteriorated to the extent that the Central govt proposed to take 
over these two universities. Roorkee was elevated to IIT, and BE college Shibpur became IIEST. Unfortunately,
BE college lost the race to gain the status of IITs. I am not sure what went wrong. Perhaps there is a policy to have only one IIT per state. 
I am sure NEP will not make any difference unless state govts cooperate or, eventually, higher education is taken off the concurrent list, or
at least science, medical, and engineering education are deleted from the concurrent list. One may view my proposal as partial to science and technical 
education. HSS does have a role. But I am sure politicians won't agree to let HSS depts go out of the concurrent list. Arousing parochial passions is the 
elixir of the political existence of many state-level parties. 

Higher Education has been an arena for political slugfest for far too long. JNU, Jadavpur, and UoH are symptomatic of these 
unsavory slugfests. However, I believe these three universities have intrinsic capabilities to bounce back if Govt make the right decisions.
I am a bit surprised how the NIRF ranking of JNU is so high. Traditionally, politics has not had much influence on science and engineering education. 
Perhaps JNU's ranking is high because of science depts.  

Coming back to enrollment of international students, in early 2000, only 5-6 students from Bangladesh were enrolled at IIT Kanpur. I know at least 1 or 2 who 
did not perform well. At that time, IIT Kanpur did not have a proactive international students' cell. Student counseling services were not taken up seriously.
As a result, many of these international students were stressed out and did not know whom to talk to and share the challenges they faced. Though Bangladesh
is less of a problem (IIT Kanpur had more than 20% Bengali-speaking professors),  faculty members can do little without institutional
support. After a while, I did not see any students from Bangladesh in my class. I also remember chatting with a Bangladesh student
who wanted to enroll in a University in Spain. He told me Indian Universities are tough to survive. I am unsure if he meant academics were challenging or
our institutions had no support system for international students. Most US universities have a powerful International Relations Office. I have not seen such
infrastructure in our country. I remember NITs had a student exchange program for Nepal, Srilanka, and Myanmar sometime back. Many Nepalese nationals used
to come to NIT (known as RECs back then). Some of these students have been very successful. I had a chance to collaborate with one such gentleman who 
graduated from REC Trichy. He was very eloquent about his time in REC Trichy. He wondered why Nepal and India do not have such an exchange now. 
I am sure international student exchange programs are revamped from time to time. I believe the Ministry of Education has not been quite proactive
in this matter. I think instead of the Federal govt being involved in micro-level details, each institute should have a good infrastructure for attracting
international students. The US, for example, has thrived because of its open policies regarding accepting graduate students in its universities. Of course, our
universities do not offer the academic standards comparable to US universities, but some of the institutions can be upgraded easily to levels of 
US universities, at least for graduate studies. However, govt meddling should stop entirely and immediately for universities to become competitive. NIRF 
ranking or regulations cannot work unless the attitude of politicians and bureaucrats changes.
