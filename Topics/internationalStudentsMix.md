## International Students Mix at Indian Universities

About 3.3 lac students from 160 different countries enrolled at different Indian Universities over a period of five years from 2016 to 2021. In 2019 about
75k chose India to pursue higher studies. Most foreign students in India came from countries like Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and very few from 
Malaysia, Iran, Maldives, Mayanmar, Yemen. On the other hand, the number of Indian students opting for medical studies in Chinese and Ukrainian 
Universities is very high. About 18000 Indian students were evacuted from Ukraine war zone recently. About 25K Indian students are enrolled in Chinese 
Unversities. Some Indian students even go to South Korea and Japan. The problem of student exchange between non-english speaking countries is understandably
low. However, India and most countries in Africa were under British rule for long time. So english language did influence higher education system between
such countries. China has been an exception as it consciously introduced English in higher education. South Korea also realized importance of English as
window for interaction in the domain of scientific education. Most the well-known universities world-wide have exchange programme of foreign students.

India announced new National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020. The NEP is supposed to increase enrollement of foreign studies in India. It spells out many 
shortcomings of current education system in India. Notable among these are:

1. Moving towards more multidisciplinary undergraduate eduction.
2. Allowing faculty and edcuation autonomy
3. Using well established padegogic practice for better student experience
4. Reaffirming faculty integrity through honest merit-based evaluation and career progression of faculty based on teaching, research and service
5. Establishment of a National Research Foundation fund for outstanding peer-reviewed research and actively seeding research in universities and colleges.
Governance of institution by high qualified independent boards having academic.

All the above points were general operating principles of most IITs and IISc when they were established on recommendations of Viceroy's Committee on 
technical education headed by Prof Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. But over the years, the govt of the day tampered with administrative autonomy and sought to 
place pliable directors and appointed persons of questionable credentials as the Chairpersons of IITs. Even some of the educationists who were board 
chairpersons of different IITs tried to tinker with micro-management of IITs through the directors. So, in paper everything looks fine. NEP or without
NEP, no educational institute is immune from external tinkering. There is also an amount of rigidity among educationists which prevented glassnost in
engineering education. Less is said about the state universities the better it is. State Universities are under direct control of state govts which never
allowed universities to frame their policies. Odisha, for example, has turned state universities into extended arm of state education dept. A
couple of vice-chancellors of Utkal and Berhampur Universities left before completing their terms. A vice-chancellor of a state university told me in
a private conversation that "the bureaucrat lackys of a CM were extending too much affection" as the cause of his
premature departure from the post. Officially, the govts may say that the VCs leaving in the middle were incompetent. But the fact remains that
education system has been pulverized by bureaucrats and politicians and the court have done little to dissuade the interferences. 

At one point of time Roorkee and BE College Shibpur were very reputed institutions. But both deteroriated to
an extent that Central govt proposed take over these two universities. Roorkee was elevated to IIT and BE college Shibpur became IIEST. Unfortunately,
BE college lost the race for gaining status of IITs. I am not sure what went wrong. Perhaps there is a policy to have only one IIT per state. 
I am sure NEP is not going to make any difference unless state govts cooperate or eventually the higher education is taken off the concurrent list. Or
at least science, medical and engineering educations are deleted from concurrent list. One may view my proposal as a partial. HSS does have a role.
But I am sure that politicians won't agree to let HSS depts go out of concurrent list. Arousing parchoial passions is the elixir of political existence
of many state level parties. 

Higher Education has been an arena for political slugfest for far too long. JNU, Jadavpur, UoH are symptomatic of these 
unsavory slugfests. However, I believe these three universities have intrinsic capabilities to bounce back if right decisions are taken by Govt.
I am bit surprised how NIRF ranking
of JNU is so high. Traditionally, politics has not much influence on science and engineering education. Perhaps JNU's ranking is high because of 
science depts.  

Coming back to enrollment of foreign students, in early 2000 only 5-6 students from Bangladesh were enrolled at IIT Kanpur. I know at least 1 or 2 who did
not perform well. At that time IIT Kanpur did not have a vibrant foreign students' cell. Student counseling was not taken seriously. As a result these 
foreign students were stressed out, and did not know whom to talk to and share the challenges they faced. Faculty members can do little without institutional
support. After a while I did not see any student from Bangladesh. I also remember having a chat with a student from Bangladesh
who wanted to enroll in a University in Spain. He told me Indian Universities are tough to survive. I am not sure what he meant by saying Indian Universities
are tough. However, I remember sometime back NITs had a student exchange program for Nepal. Many Nepalese national use to come to NIT (known as RECs 
back then). Some of these students have been very successful. I had a chance to collaborate with one such gentleman who graduated from Trichy REC. He was
wondering why Nepal and India did not have such an exchange now.
