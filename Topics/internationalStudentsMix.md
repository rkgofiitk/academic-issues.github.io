## International Students Mix at Indian Universities

About 3.3 lac students from 160 different countries enrolled at different Indian Universities over a five year period 2016-2021. In 2019 about 75k chose
India to pursue higher studies. Most foreign students in India come from countries like Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and very few from Malaysia, 
Iran, Maldives, Mayanmar, Yemen. On the other hand, the number of Indian students opting for medical studies in Chinese Universities and Ukrainian Universities
is very high. About 18000 Indian students were evacuted from Ukraine war zone recently. About 25K Indian students are enrolled in Chinese Unversities. 
India announced new National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020. The NEP is supposed to increase enrollement of foreign studies in India. It spells out many 
shortcomings of current education system in India. Notable among these are:
1. Moving towards more multidisciplinary undergraduate eduction.
2. Allowing faculty and edcuation autonomy
3. Using well established padegogic practice for better student experience
4. Reaffirming faculty integrity through honest merit-based evaluation and career progression of faculty based on teaching, research and service
5. Establishment of a National Research Foundation fund for outstanding peer-reviewed research and actively seeding research in universities and colleges.
6. Governance of institution by high qualified independent boards having academic.
All the above points were general operating principles of most IITs and IISc when they were established on recommendations of Viceroy's Committee on 
technical education headed by Prof Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. But over the years, the govt of the day tampered with administrative autonomy and sought to 
place pliable directors and appointed persons of questionable credentials as the Chairpersons of IITs. Even some of the educationists who were board 
chairpersons of different IITs tried to tinker with micro-management of IITs through the directors. So, in paper everything looks fine. NEP or without
NEP no educational institute is immune from external tinkering. There is also an amount of rigidity among educationists which prevented glassnost in
engineering education. Less is said about state universities the better it is. State Universities are under direct control of state govts which never
allows universities to frame it policies. At one point of time Roorkee and BE College Shibpur were very reputed institutions. But both deteroriated to
an extent that Central govt ep 
5-6 students from Bangladesh at IIT Kanpur during early 2000. I know at least 1 or 2 who did not perform well. At that time IIT Kanpur did not have a 
foreign students' cell. Student counseling was not taken seriously. As a result these foreign students were stressed out, and did not know whom to talk to
and share the challenges they faced. After a while I did not see any student from Bangladesh. I also remember having a chat with a student from Bangladesh
who wanted to enroll in a University in Spain. He told me Indian Universities are tough to survive. I am not sure what he meant by saying Indian Universities
are tough. Sometime back NITs had a student exchange program for Nepal. Many Nepalese national use to come to NIT (known as RECs back then). Some of these
students have been very successful.
