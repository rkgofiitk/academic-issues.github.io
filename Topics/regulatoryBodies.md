# Academic Regulatory Bodies in India

[Blog Index](../index.md)

India has many regulatory bodies for academic institutions. 


- At the first level, there are university senates.
- Next comes university syndicates. 
- The state governor is the Chancellor and is a proxy for the state govt. 
- Then we have 14 councils of higher education, which includes bodies such as UGC, AICTE, MCI. 


All first-level bodies except for the Senates of some IITs, none of these have remained insulated from politics.
 

A university senate body is typically composed of nominated members and elected members. Most of the universities have 50% of the members nominated by the 
Chancellor. The other 50% members are elected from registered graduate constituencies.  A graduate from the university must register to be eligible to vote. 
Political parties usurp the process of election entirely. Through the Chancellor, the state govt controls the nominated members. A majority of these nominated 
members are either bureaucrats or bureaucrat-friendly educators. The net result makes the university senate a useless non-functional entity. 

 

A university syndicate is the highest decision-making body that frames the administrative and academic regulations. Typically, syndicate members are elected from 
university departments. However, often govt determines who can become syndicate members. Unfortunately, vice-chancellors of universities owe their posts to 
intense lobbying; as a result, they execute the dictates from the state dept of higher education. 


Less is said about the education depts of the states better it is. The secretary of education dept is an IAS officer who is always looking for plum posting and 
would give in to any unreasonable whimsical politician's dictates if it suits. Even a well-meaning Governor is by-passed or sometimes becomes a willing 
accomplice to stifle the university system. Control freak politicians have ruined the universities with regulations and sometimes by vicarious presence through 
student bodies. The state universities act as a clearinghouse for degree certificates of no value except for a few. 

 

Madan Mohan Malviya planned an outstanding integrated university and was a visionary ahead of his time. During his chancellorship, Ramchandra Shukla became head 
of the Hindi dept at BHU. He passed the school final examination but failed in the law examination. Modern Hindi literature was propelled primarily by Shukla's 
works. As things stand today, no one will get a job except for a daily wager with a high school certificate. 

 

We talk about Washington Accord, NEP, etc., etc. However, no acts or accords will work to straighten the academic mess unless people understand the duplicity of 
politicians and banish them from meddling into temples of learning. Politicians want people to remain uneducated and unskilled. They survive exploiting the 
discontents among the mass. Equally enough, there is a requirement that academicians stop lobbying for plum posts.
