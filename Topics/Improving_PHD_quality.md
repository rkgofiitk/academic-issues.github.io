# Quality of PhDs

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Chairperson of Univrsity Grant Commission (UGC) has been pitching for improving quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian Universities. I believe it is
not the first time nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed disastisfaction about the quality of Ph D degrees. Though
present UGC Chairperson appears to be hyperactive in social network sites, perhaps UGC is not paying enough attentions to many issues at micro-level
which dissuade a majority of competent persons to pursue Ph D in Indian Universities. There are about 1200 universities and a litle over 170 CFTIs in India that offer
Ph D programs. [Less than 0.5%](https://opportunities-insight.britishcouncil.org/short-articles/news/india-releases-updated-higher-education-statistics) of 
students enrolled in higher education in India opt for pursuing Ph D programs. Of course, just over 2% of the population in US and other developed European
countries hold PhDs. Indeed, PhD is supposed to a difficult degree. There are only 8 million PhD holders in the world as per 2014 data. The [Statista 
infochart](https://www.statista.com/chart/7272/the-countries-with-the-most-doctoral-graduates/) tells that US produces 67k PhDs per year whereas
India produces 24k PhDs annually. Out of 43.3 million students enrolled in higher educational institutes across India only 0.5%, i.e, 216500 students enroll
for PhDs in India. The why under 25k students graduate with a degree? In 2019, the enrollment figure was 202550. So, even assuming average tenure of the
program is 5 years, we should be producing at least 50k PhDs per year (calculating at a mean completion rate of lower than 25%). The mean completion
rate is not even 11% of the enrollment. US universities annually enroll a little over a million of international students. The [mean completion rate for PhD from
US is over 50%](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2008/11/phd). Many would say that comparison with USA is not fair. However, I believe there is no reason to compare 
demographically with lesser developed nations if we aspire to become world leaders. 


The number of international students in Indian institutions is just about 46k in 2021-2022 which dropped by 2% from the previous year. Whereas the international 
students enrollments in USA is about a million followed by UK, Canada over half a million. USA is the most preferred destination of international students 
for PhD programs. They account for [35% of Phd enrollments](https://monitor.icef.com/2023/10/further-growth-in-international-enrolment-in-us-graduate-programmes/) 
in private not for profit universities. Even countries like Nzealand welcomed over 73k international students. It made me wonder why Indian institutions/universities
are not preferred by foreign students from neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mynamar, Srilanka, Nepal, Thailand, Philipines, Maldives, Mauritius. 
There is an [insightful post](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Indian-education-system-fail-compared-to-the-global-universities-and-colleges) 
in quora by Anbazhagan Ambrose who explains the issues that dissuade international students to opt for enrollment in UG programs in engineering at Indian institutions while drawing.
comparison with universities in Germany. At least ten universities in Germany are 500 years old, in contrast the oldest university 
in India is only about 170 years old. Ambrose observes that educational change is atributed to generational change. Most parents of low quality graduates
from Tier-2 and Tier-3 engineering institutes in India have had schooling up to 10th grade. After 50 year India attained a generational change with
the current generation of students have access to better intellecutal capitals  from their parents. While this may be true about undergraduate studies, as
far as graduate studies is concerned, the comment is irrelevant, because inherited intellectual capital is of little use. However, the quality of
research and technical advancement of a countery does influence the expectation from a PhD program. India's economic progress is largely dependent on
service oriented inductries. The country does not have a large manufacturing base. Manufacturing sector only accounts for 12-13% of GDP. It should
account for at least 30% of GDP. It explains why PhD programs even in reputed universities are centered around theoretical foundations with low technological
content. 

The general feeling is that the fate of anyone joining the [PhD program in a private university in India is doomed.](https://www.moneylife.in/article/doing-phd-in-india-think-thrice/52923.html)
Going through a sample of social media posts, the verdict is that India is the worst place to do PhD even in reputed institutions like IISc, IITs, and IIESR.
The situation in government sponsored labs are even worse, where you may often hear that chief of lab claim credits for all research  publications from their
respective labs. Even government funding agencies are not immune from syndrom of hunting credits. Some teaching faculty in one of the new IITs shared one
incident related to the release of sanctioned fund on the condition of sharing credits for publication.

So, I find that there is some truth in two of major criticisms a
- Systemic Corruption and
- Issues with supervisors and other colleagues

appears to be true.  Corruption any way endemic to the countries with a long colonial past. The colonial governance apparently conditioned the general 
population in normalizing "greasing plams" (euphimsm for paying a processing fee to a government official) for a legitimate approval. The situation hascontinued 
until very recently when Internet did not exist or has not widely spread across India. The younger generation of population is now aware of their rights and 
limits of approval authorities. However, habits die hard, so the corruption is still very endemic to our system of governance. Government officials have
found newer ways to harass citizens, among these delaying tactic is one important tool. The single most pain point is finance or the money as I have 
already pointed out. One can easily find minor faults in an application seeking approval and stall it. I had exeperience in dealing with DST, CSIR, BNRS,
and the local disbursing authorities. Funding agenecies have usual beureacratic problem at low-end office assistants. Luckily, all higher officials I met
had helped to sort out the problem as fast as they could. However, I guess that older IITs have added advantage that probably is not available to new
institutions. Even then, I found having a foreign research grant is simpler to handle though local purchase and account department may try to meddle a bit. 
In summary, I feel the low-level corruption is hurting us more than the high-level corruption.

The single most irritant for a research scholar is interpersonal relationship with supervisor and colleagues under the same supervisor/and or department. 
Most supervisors at even in India's leading institutions treat a research scholar as personal assistant and a helping hand. In one of my old posts I 
described a few [anecdotes](Topics/PhDstudents.md) about treatment of scholara by their supervisors in many reputed institutions of India. Absence of a 
healthy mutual respectful interpersonal relationship breed contempt for the supervisor and leads to serious animosity betweeen advisee and advisor
starts affecting demeanour of a scholar. The kind of problems between an advisee and advisor could be:
- Lack of communiation
- Absent supervisor
- Overbearing supervisor
- Changing supervisor

The root of the problem is lack of communication between the parties. Unless there is a healthy undertanding and regular communication between advisee and 
advisor, it is impossible to complete the requirements for the degree. Since PhD is a longtime commitment the relationship between two is develop over time
and may change from time to time. The mentee being a younger may have little patient. It is the role of mentor to handle the mantee carefully. However, 
the mentee should be aware of his/her responsibilities. An absentee supervisor need to create a channel for regular updates from the students possibly 
through slackware, github and hold online meetings to avoid miscommunication or lack of communication. However, the problem of overbearing supervisor could
shatter the mental health of a schola. Usually, control freaks or younger supervisors often tend to be overbearing. Frequent meetings are counter productive. 
The shcolar should tactfully avoid a direct clash with the supervisor and develop a skill for negotiation. Opting for a co-supervisor could make things 
easier. PhD is not just an academic degree or a relationship of one-night-stand. It demands skills such as planning and management. 
Changing supervisor is a complex issue. Most supervisors in IITs, IISc, or elsewhere resent scholar initiated supervisor change. However, if scholar 
loses interest in topic of research, then it could bite back the supervisor in the long run. So, for the best interest of all concerned, the supervisor 
should let go the scholar. Still changing supervisor is very complex and could create unease even between the scholar and the new supervisor or 
the department. Therefore, selection of a supervisor is a big step before starting a PhD program. It is necessary that the scholars should spend time
to research the pros and cons of choosing a supervisor. Study the credentials including the person's inter-personal relationship with past students before
joining a specific supervisor. Often it may not be possible due to various reasons including availability of research grants. In that case, the scholar 
should be able to make adjust to a supervior knowing the expectations beforehand.

Apart from the two major issues discussed above, a few other several micro-level management problems that the scholars face could be:
- Resource paucity 
- Placement after Ph. D.
- Personal committments
- No grievance redresssal
- Insistance on GATE/NET 

Most university start offering Ph. D. degrees almost immediately without caring for quality. A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100  university and 42000 colleges. From 2014, we started adding 40 
new universites per year. However, the qauality of these institutions are very low. At the risk of making a sweeping comment, I think private universities
established between early eighties to mid nineties may have stablized as far as UG programs are concerned. But I don't think they have reached a 
stage to offer good PhD programs. In other words, none of them have reached a generational change as far as PhD program is concerned.

About 4.14 corers enrollment in institutions across India. The governments in the past 50 years since the country's independence
from Briish did not think much about education. Perhaps politics of keeping mass away from education is a democratic decision as is giving universal 
adult franchise. Only a few institutions were added during the time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted chief scientific 
advisor of the government, he persuaded the primeminister to build specialized labs. The government of the day simply reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR and DAE. Existing public universities experience a cut in funding. Funding crunch excerbated survival of universities. Many reputed professors left
university system. Their places were taken by ill-equipped educators who neight had capabilities nor had inclination to achieve excellence. As a result the 
university system crumbled.
