# Quality of PhDs

[Blog Index](../index.md)

The Chairperson of the University Grant Commission (UGC) has been pitching to improve the quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian universities. 
I believe it is not the first time, nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed dissatisfaction about the quality of Ph D
degrees. Though the present UGC Chairperson appears to be hyperactive on social network sites, perhaps UGC is not paying enough attention to many issues at 
the micro-level which dissuades a majority of competent persons from pursuing Ph D in Indian Universities. There are about 1200 universities and a little 
over 170 CFTIs in India that offer Ph D programs. [Less than 0.5%](https://opportunities-insight.britishcouncil.org/short-articles/news/india-releases-updated-higher-education-statistics) of 
students enrolled in higher education in India opt for pursuing Ph D programs. Of course, just over 2% of the population in the US and other developed European
countries hold PhDs. Indeed, a PhD is a difficult degree. There are only 8 million PhD holders in the world, as per 2014 data. The [Statista 
infochart](https://www.statista.com/chart/7272/the-countries-with-the-most-doctoral-graduates/) tells that US produces 67k PhDs per year whereas
India produces 24k PhDs annually. Of 43.3 million students enrolled in higher educational institutes across India, only 0.5%, i.e., 216500 students, enroll
for PhDs in India. Why do under 25k students only graduate with a degree? In 2019, the enrollment figure was 202550. Even assuming the average tenure of the
program is 5 years, we should be producing at least 50k PhDs per year (calculating at a mean completion rate of lower than 25%). The mean completion
rate is not even 11% of the enrollment. US universities annually enroll a little over a million international students. The [mean completion rate for PhD from
US is over 55%](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2008/11/phd). Many say that comparison with the USA is not fair. However, there is no reason to compare 
demographically with lesser developed nations if we aspire to become world leaders. 


The number of international students in Indian institutions is just about 46k in 2021-2022, which dropped by 2% from the previous year. Whereas the 
international student enrollment in the USA is about a million, followed by the UK, Canada each with over half a million enrollment. The USA is the
most preferred destination for international students for PhD programs. They account for [35% of PhD enrollments](https://monitor.icef.com/2023/10/further-growth-in-international-enrolment-in-us-graduate-programmes/) 
in private not-for-profit universities. Even countries like Newzealand welcomed over 73k international students. It made me wonder why Indian institutions/
universities are not preferred by international students from neighboring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Philippines, 
Maldives, and Mauritius. There is an [insightful post](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Indian-education-system-fail-compared-to-the-global-universities-and-colleges) 
in Quora by Anbazhagan Ambrose. Ambrose explains the issues that dissuade international students from enrolling in UG programs in engineering at Indian 
institutions drawing comparisons with universities in Germany. At least ten universities in Germany are 500 years old; in contrast, the oldest university in 
India is only about 170 years old. Ambrose observes further that educational change is attributed to generational change. Most parents of low-quality graduates
from Tier-2 and Tier-3 engineering institutes in India have been in school up to 10th grade. After 50 years, India attained a generational change, with
the current generation of students having access to better intellectual capital from their parents. While this may be true about undergraduate studies, as
far as graduate studies are concerned, the comment is irrelevant because inherited intellectual capital is of little use. However, the quality of
research and technical advancement of a country influence the expectations of a PhD program. India's economic progress is dependent mainly on
service-oriented industries. The country has a small manufacturing base. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 12-13% of GDP. It should
account for at least 30% of GDP. It explains why PhD programs, even in reputed universities, are centered around theoretical foundations with low technological
content. 

The general feeling is that the fate of anyone joining the [PhD program in a private university in India is doomed.](https://www.moneylife.in/article/doing-phd-in-india-think-thrice/52923.html)
A sample of social media posts reveals that the general verdict is that India is the worst place to do PhD even in reputed institutions like IISc, IITs, and 
IIESR. The situation in government-sponsored labs is even worse, where you may often hear that the chief of lab claims credits for all research publications 
from their respective labs. Even government funding agencies are not immune from the syndrome of hunting credits. Some teaching faculty in one of the new IITs 
shared one incident related to releasing sanctioned funds on the condition of sharing credits for publication.

So, I find that there is some truth in two of the major criticisms:
- Systemic Corruption and
- Issues with supervisors and other colleagues

Corruption is endemic to the countries with a long colonial past. The colonial governance conditioned the general 
population to normalize "greasing palms" (a euphemism for paying a processing fee to a government official) for legitimate approval. The situation has continued 
until very recently when the Internet did not exist or has not spread widely across India. The younger population is now aware of their rights and 
limits of approval authorities. However, habits die hard, so corruption is still very endemic to our system of governance. Government officials have
found newer ways to harass citizens, delaying tactics being one important tool. The most dominating pain point is finance or the money, as I have 
already pointed out. One can easily find minor faults in an application seeking approval and stall it. I have experience dealing with DST, CSIR, BNRS,
and the local disbursing authorities at my institute. Funding agencies have the usual bureaucratic problems at low-end office assistants. Luckily,
all the higher officials I met had helped sort out the problem as quickly as possible. However, older IITs have an added advantage that probably is 
not available to newer institutions. Even then, having a foreign research grant is more straightforward to handle, though the local purchase and 
account department may meddle a bit. In summary, the low-level corruption hurts us more than the high-level corruption.

The most irritant for a research scholar is interpersonal relationships with supervisors and colleagues under the same supervisor/or department. 
Most supervisors, even in India's leading institutions, treat a research scholar as a personal assistant and a helping hand. In one of my old posts, I 
described a few [anecdotes](Topics/PhDstudents.md) about the treatments meted out to research scholars by their respective supervisors in many 
reputed institutions in India. The absence of a healthy, mutual, respectful interpersonal relationship breeds contempt for the supervisor and leads to 
serious animosity between advisee and advisor, affecting a scholar's demeanor. The kind of problems between an advisee and advisor could be:
- Lack of communication
- Absent supervisor
- Overbearing supervisor
- Changing supervisor

The root of the problem is a lack of communication between the parties. Unless there is a healthy understanding and regular communication between the advisee 
and advisor, it is impossible to complete the requirements for the degree. Since a PhD is a longtime commitment, the relationship between the two develops over 
time and may change from time to time. The mentee is younger and may have little patience. It is the role of the mentor to handle the mentee carefully. However, 
the mentee should be aware of their responsibilities. An absentee supervisor needs to create a channel for regular updates from the students, possibly 
through Slackware, or GitHub, and hold online meetings to avoid miscommunication or lack of communication. However, the problem of an overbearing supervisor 
could shatter the mental health of a scholar. Usually, control freaks or younger supervisors often tend to be overbearing. Frequent meetings are 
counterproductive. The scholar should tactfully avoid a direct clash with the supervisor and develop negotiation skills. Opting for a co-supervisor could make 
things easier. PhD is not just an academic degree or a relationship of one-night-stand. It demands skills such as planning and management. 
Changing supervisor is a complex issue. Most supervisors in IITs, IISc, or elsewhere resent scholar-initiated supervisor change. However, if a scholar 
loses interest in the topic of research, then it could bite back the supervisor in the long run. So, for the best interest of all concerned, the supervisor 
should let go the scholar. Still, changing supervisors is very complex and could create unease, even between the scholar, the new supervisor, or 
the department. Therefore, selecting a supervisor is a big step before starting a PhD program. The scholars must spend time
researching the pros and cons of choosing a supervisor. Before joining a specific supervisor, study the credentials, including the person's interpersonal 
relationship with past students. It may not be possible for various reasons, including the availability of research grants. In that case, the scholar 
should be able to adjust to a supervisor knowing the expectations beforehand.

Apart from the two major issues discussed above, a few other micro-level management problems that the scholars face could be:
- Resource paucity 
- Placement after Ph. D.
- Personal commitments
- No grievance redressal
- Insistence on GATE/NET 

Most universities start offering Ph. D. degrees almost immediately without caring for quality. A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100 universities and 42000 colleges. From 2014, we started adding 40 
new universities per year. However, the quality of these institutions is very low. At the risk of making a sweeping comment, private universities
established between the early eighties and mid-nineties may have stabilized UG programs. However, they have yet to reach a 
stage where they can offer good PhD programs. In other words, they have yet to reach a generational change regarding the PhD program.

About 4.14 corers enroll in institutions across India. In the past 50 years since the country's independence
from the British, the governments have not thought much about education. Perhaps the politics of keeping mass away from education is a democratic decision, as 
is giving universal adult franchise. The government added only a handful of institutions during that time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted  as the
government's scientific advisor, he persuaded the Prime Minister of the day to build specialized labs. The government reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR, DAE, DRDO, and so on. Existing public universities experience a cut in funding. The funding crunch exacerbated the survival of these public 
universities.Many reputed professors left universities for places where opportunities were better. The vacuum was replaced by less deserving people eager to 
compromise to enjoy government patronage. It was an intellectual disaster that ruined the universities and brought in a sycophancy not
seen in the academic world. On the other hand, labs developed a culture of person-centric fiefdom that discouraged talents. Perhaps ISRO and BARC were the only
two exceptional institutions that emerged from the conundrum.
