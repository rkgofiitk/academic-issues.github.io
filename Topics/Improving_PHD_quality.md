# Quality of PhDs

Chairperson of Univrsity Grant Commission (UGC) has pitched for improving quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian Universities. I believe it is
not the first time nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed disastisfaction about the quality of Ph D degrees. Though
present UGC Chairperson appears to be hyperactive in social network sites, he probably is not paying attentions to many issues discussed in social media
about the difficulties that students face in persuing a Ph. D. in India. Not all universities including IITs or IISc offer a decent work environment for
Ph. D. scholars. Some of issues related environment arise due to r. Ph. D.
is a sort of personal committment with the supervisor. So, many problems that affect the quality of Ph. D. may germinate from a scholar's inability to 
take an informed decision to join a specific supervisor. Sometimes a scholar is unable to extricate from clutches of a supervisor if the latter is 
abusive. 
There are several micro-management problems that the scholars face could be:
- Resource paucity issues
- Placement issues after Ph. D.
- Personal committment issues
- Abusive and incompetent supervisor
- Timely release of scholarship
- No grievance redresssal
- Insistance on GATE/NET 

Quality of teaching has never been a determining parameter for survival of a university in the country. UGC enforced Ph. D. in the required discipline
as a minimum requirement for a faculty position, hoping that quality of faculty would automatically improve the quality of degrees in engineering awarded 
by our universities. It has not worked, as most university started offering Ph. D. degrees without caring for quality. 
are useless A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100  university and 42000 colleges. About 4.14 corers enrollment in 
institutions across India. The governments in the past 50 years since the country's independence
from Briish did not think much about education. Only a few institutions were added during the time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted chief scientific 
advisor of the government, he persuaded the primeminister to build specialized labs. The government of the day simply reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR and DAE. Universities experience a cut in funding. Funding crunch excerbated survival of universities. Many reputed professors left university 
system. Their places were taken by ill-equipped educators who neight had capabilities nor had inclination to achieve excellence. As a result the university
system crumbled. 


I had an old post about how the [PhD students are treated](Topics/PhDstudents.md)in many reputed institutions in India.
