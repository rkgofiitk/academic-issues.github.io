# Quality of PhDs

Chairperson of Univrsity Grant Commission (UGC) has been pitching for improving quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian Universities. I believe it is
not the first time nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed disastisfaction about the quality of Ph D degrees. Though
present UGC Chairperson appears to be hyperactive in social network sites, perhaps UGC is not paying enough attentions to many issues at micro-level
which dissuade a majority of competent persons to pursue Ph D in Indian Universities. There are about 1200 universities and a litle over 170 CFTIs in India that offer
Ph D programs. [Less than 0.5%](https://opportunities-insight.britishcouncil.org/short-articles/news/india-releases-updated-higher-education-statistics) of 
students enrolled in higher education in India opt for pursuing Ph D programs. Of course, just over 2% of the population in US and other developed European
countries hold PhDs. Indeed, PhD is supposed to a difficult degree. There are only 8 million PhD holders in the world as per 2014 data. The [Statista 
infochart](https://www.statista.com/chart/7272/the-countries-with-the-most-doctoral-graduates/) tells that US produces 67k PhDs per year whereas
India produces 24k PhDs annually. Out of 43.3 million students enrolled in higher educational institutes across India only 0.5%, i.e, 216500 students enroll
for PhDs in India. The why under 25k students graduate with a degree? In 2019, the enrollment figure was 202550. So, even assuming average tenure of the
program is 5 years, we should be producing at least 50k PhDs per year (calculating at a mean completion rate of lower than 25%). The mean completion
rate is not even 11% of the enrollment. US universities annually enroll a little over a million of international students. The [mean completion rate for PhD from
US is over 50%](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2008/11/phd). Many would say that comparison with USA is not fair. However, I believe there is no reason to compare 
demographically with lesser developed nations if we aspire to become world leaders. 


The number of international students in Indian institutions is just about 46k in 2021-2022 which dropped by 2% from the previous year. Whereas the international 
students enrollments in USA is about a million followed by UK, Canada over half a million. USA is the most preferred destination of international students 
for PhD programs. They account for [35% of Phd enrollments](https://monitor.icef.com/2023/10/further-growth-in-international-enrolment-in-us-graduate-programmes/) 
in private not for profit universities. Even countries like Nzealand welcomed over 73k international students. It made me wonder why Indian institutions/universities
are not preferred by foreign students from neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mynamar, Srilanka, Nepal, Thailand, Philipines, Maldives, Mauritius. 
There is an [insightful post](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Indian-education-system-fail-compared-to-the-global-universities-and-colleges) 
in quora by Anbazhagan Ambrose who explains the issues that dissuade international students to opt for enrollment in UG programs in engineering at Indian institutions.
He analyzes the issue by drawing comparison with Germany. There are at least ten universities in Germany that are 500 years old, in contrast the oldest university 
in India is only about 170 years old. Ambrose observes that educational change depends on generational change. The parents of low quality graduates from Tier-2 and
Tier-3 engineering institutes in India are mostly 10th grade qualifiers. India after 50 year could attend the thresholds of an educational change as the current 
generation of students have access to better intellecutal capitals  from their parents. While this may be true about undergraduate studies, the situation in graduate
studies in India still remains very poor. 

The general feeling is that the fate of anyone joining the [PhD program in a private university in India is doomed.](https://www.moneylife.in/article/doing-phd-in-india-think-thrice/52923.html)
Going through a sample of social media posts, the verdict is that India is the worst place to do PhD even in reputed institutions like IISc, IITs, and IIESR. The 
two major criticism appears to be directed towards
- Systemic Corruption and
- Issues with supervisors and other colleagues

Corruption endemic in countries with a long colonial past. The colonial governance apparently conditioned the general population in normalizing "greasing plams" 
(euphimsm for paying a processing fee to a government official) for a legitimate approval. The situation has continued until very recently when Internet did not 
exist or has not widely spread across India. The younger generation of population is now aware of their rights and limits of approval authorities. However, as we 
know habits die hard, so the corruption is still very endemic to our system of governance. Government officials have found different ways to harass citizens,
among these delaying tactic is one important tool. The single most pain point is finance or the money. One can easily find minor faults in an application seeking
approval and stall it. I had exeperience in dealing with DST, CSIR, BNRS, and the local disbursing authorities. Funding agenecies have usual beureacratic problem
at low-end office assistants. Luckily, all higher officials I met had helped to sort out the problem as fast as they could.  Stil, I found having a
foreign research grant is simpler to handle even if local purchase and account department may meddle a bit.  

The single most irritant for a research scholar is interpersonal relationship with supervisor and colleagues under the same supervisor/and or department. 
Most supervisors at even in India's leading institutions treat a research scholar as personal assistant and a helping hand. It breed contempt for the supervisor
and the animosity betweeen advisee and advisor start affecting demeanour of a scholar. The kind of problems between an advisee and advisor could be:
- Lack of communiation
- Absent supervisor
- Overbearing supervisor
- Changing supervisor

The root of the problem is lack of communication between the parties. Unless there is a healthy undertanding and regular communication between advisee and advisor, 
it is impossible to complete the requirements for the degree. Since PhD is a longtime commitment the relationship between two is develop over time and may change
from time to time. The mentee being a younger may have little patient. It is the role of mentor to handle the mantee carefully. However, the mentee should be 
aware of his/her responsibilities. An absentee supervisor need to create a channel for regular updates from the students possibly through slack, github and
hold online meet to avoid miscommunication and lack of communication. However, the problem of overbearing supervisor is where the responsibilities of a scholar
becomes more demanding. Usually, control freaks or younger supervisor tend to be overbearing. Frequent meeting could be counter productive.  The shcolar has
to tactfully avoid a direct clash with the supervisor and develop a skill for negotiation. Perhaps opting for co-supervisor could make things easier. Remember
PhD is not just an academic degree it also demands skills such as planning and management. Changing supervisor is a complex issue. Most supervisor in IITs
or elsewhere resent the change. However, if scholar loses interest in topic of research, then it could bite back the supervisor in the long run. So, for best
interest of all concerned the supervisor should let go the scholar. Still changing supervisor is very complex and could create unease between the scholar and
the department. Therefore, selection of supervisor is a big step before starting a PhD program. It is necessary that the scholars should make an informed 
assessment of the probable supervisor and topic of research. Study the credentials including the person's inter-personal relationship with past students before
joining a specific supervisor. Often it may be possible due to various reasons including availability of research grants. In that case, the scholar should be
able to make an assessment of the pros and cons before joining. 

I have been going through various posts in social media sites about the poor quality graduate programs in India. Having been associated with one of the 
older IITs for over three decades, I noticed many ups and downs in this respect. Around 1980s, only a few institutes were offering PhD programs, mostly in 
science subjects. Scholarship for a students were absymally low. Many were financially supported by their parents. Only around 2000 things improved a lot. Now
the situation is different. Granting agencies are more liberal in sanctioning money. In private university, this may not the case. Only a few reputed private
universities could provide financial support, but they would make the scholar work for the payment in terms of teaching roles. 


education remains pathetically theory oriented. Often well networked loud mouth babblers and people with specific agenda sieze control of 
decision making in academic regulatory bodies. Unfortunately, our system can neither recognize nor disassociate those elements from government policy making. 

major issue in persuing Ph Ds in India. about the difficulties that students face in persuing a Ph. D. in India. Not all universities including IITs or IISc offer a decent work environment for
Ph. D. scholars. Some of issues related environment arise due to r. Ph. D.
is a sort of personal committment with the supervisor. So, many problems that affect the quality of Ph. D. may germinate from a scholar's inability to 
take an informed decision to join a specific supervisor. Sometimes a scholar is unable to extricate from clutches of a supervisor if the latter is 
abusive. 
There are several micro-management problems that the scholars face could be:
- Resource paucity issues
- Placement issues after Ph. D.
- Personal committment issues
- Abusive and incompetent supervisor
- Timely release of scholarship
- No grievance redresssal
- Insistance on GATE/NET 

Quality of teaching has never been a determining parameter for survival of a university in the country. UGC enforced Ph. D. in the required discipline
as a minimum requirement for a faculty position, hoping that quality of faculty would automatically improve the quality of degrees in engineering awarded 
by our universities. It has not worked, as most university started offering Ph. D. degrees without caring for quality. 
are useless A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100  university and 42000 colleges. About 4.14 corers enrollment in 
institutions across India. The governments in the past 50 years since the country's independence
from Briish did not think much about education. Only a few institutions were added during the time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted chief scientific 
advisor of the government, he persuaded the primeminister to build specialized labs. The government of the day simply reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR and DAE. Universities experience a cut in funding. Funding crunch excerbated survival of universities. Many reputed professors left university 
system. Their places were taken by ill-equipped educators who neight had capabilities nor had inclination to achieve excellence. As a result the university
system crumbled. 


I had an old post about how the [PhD students are treated](Topics/PhDstudents.md)in many reputed institutions in India.
