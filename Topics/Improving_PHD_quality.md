# Quality of PhDs

Chairperson of Univrsity Grant Commission (UGC) has been pitching for improving quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian Universities. I believe it is
not the first time nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed disastisfaction about the quality of Ph D degrees. Though
present UGC Chairperson appears to be hyperactive in social network sites, perhaps UGC is not paying enough attentions to many issues at micro-level
which dissuade a majority of competent persons to pursue Ph D in Indian Universities. There are about 1200 universities and a litle over 170 CFTIs in India that offer
Ph D programs. [Less than 0.5%](https://opportunities-insight.britishcouncil.org/short-articles/news/india-releases-updated-higher-education-statistics) of 
students enrolled in higher education in India opt for pursuing Ph D programs. Of course, just over 2% of the population in US and other developed European
countries hold PhDs. Indeed, PhD is supposed to a difficult degree. There are only 8 million PhD holders in the world as per 2014 data. The [Statista 
infochart](https://www.statista.com/chart/7272/the-countries-with-the-most-doctoral-graduates/) tells that US produces 67k PhDs per year whereas
India produces 24k PhDs annually. Out of 43.3 million students enrolled in higher educational institutes across India only 0.5%, i.e, 216500 students enroll
for PhDs in India. The why under 25k students graduate with a degree? In 2019, the enrollment figure was 202550. So, even assuming average tenure of the
program is 5 years, we should be producing at least 50k PhDs per year (calculating at a mean completion rate of lower than 25%). The mean completion
rate is not even 11% of the enrollment. US universities annually enroll a little over a million of international students. The [mean completion rate for PhD from
US is over 50%](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2008/11/phd). Many would say that comparison with USA is not fair. However, I believe there is no reason to compare 
demographically with lesser developed nations if we aspire to become world leaders. 


The number of international students in Indian institutions is just about 46k in 2021-2022 which dropped by 2% from the previous year. The international students 
account for [35% of Phd enrollments](https://monitor.icef.com/2023/10/further-growth-in-international-enrolment-in-us-graduate-programmes/) in private not for
profit US universities. There is an [insightful post](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Indian-education-system-fail-compared-to-the-global-universities-and-colleges) 
in quora by Anbazhagan Ambrose who explains the issues that dissuade international students to opt for enrollment in UG programs in Indian institutions. He
says there are at least 10 universities in Germany that are 500 years old, in contrast the oldest university in India is only about 170 years old. Ambrose 
observes that educational change depends on generational. The parents of low quality graduates are mostly 10th grade qualifiers. However, India in thresholds
of a educational change as the current generation students have access to better intellecutal capitals  from their parents. While this may be true about
undergraduate studies, the situation in graduate studies in India will still remain very poor. 

The general feeling is that the fate of anyone joining the [PhD program in a private university in India is doomed.](https://www.moneylife.in/article/doing-phd-in-india-think-thrice/52923.html)
India is considered as a worst place to do PhD even in reputed institutions like IISc, IITs, and IIESR. The major criticism targets the corruption and issues
with the supervisors. Corruption seems to be a big issue in most countries with a long collonial past. Collonial governance has conditioned the general
population with attitude ot nornalizing greasing plams on every walks of life. However, students who may opt for doing PhDs won't take it kindly. 

I have been going through various posts in social media sites about the poor quality graduate programs in India. Having been associated with one of the 
older IITs for over three decades, I noticed many ups and downs in this respect. Around 1980s, only a few institutes were offering PhD programs, mostly in 
science subjects. Scholarship for a students were absymally low. Many were financially supported by their parents. Only around 2000 things improved a lot.
However, there are a host of other issues:
- Resource and lab issue remained a sore point.


education remains pathetically theory oriented. Often well networked loud mouth babblers and people with specific agenda sieze control of 
decision making in academic regulatory bodies. Unfortunately, our system can neither recognize nor disassociate those elements from government policy making. 

major issue in persuing Ph Ds in India. about the difficulties that students face in persuing a Ph. D. in India. Not all universities including IITs or IISc offer a decent work environment for
Ph. D. scholars. Some of issues related environment arise due to r. Ph. D.
is a sort of personal committment with the supervisor. So, many problems that affect the quality of Ph. D. may germinate from a scholar's inability to 
take an informed decision to join a specific supervisor. Sometimes a scholar is unable to extricate from clutches of a supervisor if the latter is 
abusive. 
There are several micro-management problems that the scholars face could be:
- Resource paucity issues
- Placement issues after Ph. D.
- Personal committment issues
- Abusive and incompetent supervisor
- Timely release of scholarship
- No grievance redresssal
- Insistance on GATE/NET 

Quality of teaching has never been a determining parameter for survival of a university in the country. UGC enforced Ph. D. in the required discipline
as a minimum requirement for a faculty position, hoping that quality of faculty would automatically improve the quality of degrees in engineering awarded 
by our universities. It has not worked, as most university started offering Ph. D. degrees without caring for quality. 
are useless A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100  university and 42000 colleges. About 4.14 corers enrollment in 
institutions across India. The governments in the past 50 years since the country's independence
from Briish did not think much about education. Only a few institutions were added during the time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted chief scientific 
advisor of the government, he persuaded the primeminister to build specialized labs. The government of the day simply reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR and DAE. Universities experience a cut in funding. Funding crunch excerbated survival of universities. Many reputed professors left university 
system. Their places were taken by ill-equipped educators who neight had capabilities nor had inclination to achieve excellence. As a result the university
system crumbled. 


I had an old post about how the [PhD students are treated](Topics/PhDstudents.md)in many reputed institutions in India.
