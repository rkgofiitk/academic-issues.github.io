# Quality of PhDs

Chairperson of Univrsity Grant Commission (UGC) has pitched for improving quality of Ph. D. degrees being awarded by Indian Universities. I believe it is
not the first time nor will it be the last time an incumbent Chairperson UGC publicly expressed disastisfaction about the quality of degrees being awarded
by many of our Universities. Quality has never been a determining parameter for survival of a university in the country. A country with over 1.4 billion
people requires a lot of universities. As of 2023, India has a little of 1100  university and 42000 colleges. About 4.14 corers enrollment in 
institutions across India. The governments in the past 50 years since the country's independence
from Briish did not think much about education. Only a few institutions were added during the time. When Homi Bhabha was inducted chief scientific 
advisor of the government, he persuaded the primeminister to build specialized labs. The government of the day simply reallocated resources from universities
to CSIR and DAE. Universities experience a cut in funding. Funding crunch excerbated survival of universities. Many reputed professors left university 
system. Their places were taken by ill-equipped educators who neight had capabilities nor had inclination to achieve excellence. As a result the university
system crumbled. 


I had an old post about how the [PhD students are treated](Topics/PhDstudents.md)in many reputed institutions in India.
