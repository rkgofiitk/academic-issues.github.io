# Killing Factories of Kota!

I came across two articles recently touching various issues including lack of quality education in context of series of suicides
of aspirants registered in different coaching centers operating from Kota. [One of the articles](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/what-the-kota-factory-suicides-say-about-our-education-system/) 
by Prof V. Ramgopal Rao, VC of BIT Pilani. It goes a bit into the issues that require more analysis. 
[The other article](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2023/09/suicides-in-kota-students-need-career.html?m=1) by Prof Dheeraj Sanghi, 
VC of JKLU, Jaipur. Dheeraj was my colleague at IIT Kanpur. His views on education system and career counselling advises to IIT 
JEE qualifiers are well respected. I don't know Prof Ramgopal personally but have seen his post from time to time after 
he became Director of IIT Delhi during the period 2016-2022. 

Kota is a town in Rajasthan known for its coaching centers. In past, there have been numerous attempts to curb coaching 
activities. Major changes in "IIT JEE" were administered by Kapil Sibal MHRD in first UPA cabinet with apparent target of 
curbing menace of Coaching centers. Socialogist, politicians and educationists have denounced coaching a malady without
addressing the root cause. Two popular TV series "kota factory" (Netflix) and "crash course" (Amazon Prime) depicted facets 
of lives young aspirants in private hostels their interactions with teachers of coaching centrs. They aslo out to the 
socio-economic issues that affect the lives of India's middle class people in their quest for cherised aspirations. However, 
no body dares makes an honest attempt to point out the "curse of scaling" on our education system. Both the above mentioned
article talk about scaling issue from point of view of engineering education. Dheeraj's article goes a bit deeper with some
facts and figures. 

The entire echo-system of coaching centers operate  at Kota, Vizag, New Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, and Ranchi or 
elsewhere in the country. About 100k students are enrolled every year in different coaching
centers at Kota. It records three suicides per month in average or 30-35 suicides per year. The figures for other cities are
unknown. But I guess the average rate may be slightly lower among sspirants at different cities or towns. It might be due to 
various reasons including unorganized small coaching centers at other cities where level of aspiration is lower among the 
peer groups. 

Let us start with a bit of figures explaining thriving coaching business.  The number of aspirants in JEE Mains is
about 900.5k, and approximately 2000.5k in NEET. So, we are talking about 31 lacs aspirants. The number of seats is 100k
for NEET qualified students, and 39k in JEE Mains. JEE advance offers 17k whereas AIIMS offers only 2k seats. Some of the
other well known medical collages in India are: KGM Lucknow, JIPMER Puduchery, PGIMER Chandigarh, Kasturba Medical College 
Manipal, JNMC Aligarh, SRMC Chennai, GSVMMC Kanpur, SCBMC Cuttack and few others. Though there are 612 medical colleges, 
48k seats are in govt run colleges. We know about 20k medical students were evacuated when Ukraine war started. About 5k 
students go every year to China for medical studies. That makes about 25-30k students going to foreign countries for MBBS 
degrees each year. Though it is an unbalanced comparison, we are talking about 310k aspirants who compete for only 
65k (17k engineering + 48k medical) seats. The overall success rate is 4.7%. In plain terms only 47 out of every 1000 
aspirants are successful. If we talk about NEET, the success rate drops to 0.02%.

Prof Ramgopal links the problem to our education system. I agree with the assessment though there are some areas where
I disagree his analysis and recommendations. Let me first deal with agreement part. The article speaks of five key issues. 

- Imbalance in demand-supply ratio
- Disparity between top and other institutions
- Media emphasis on high salaries
- Lack of resources for expansion
- Rising lower middle-class aspirations

I have already talked about the first two points in terms of figures. An overall success rate of 4.7% is a pathetic commentry
on Indian policy makers and planners. I believe politicians deliberately prevented the access to education to general
public in fear of losing their clouts. I would term it as a colonial mind-set. In 1991, when PV Narshima Rao became PM, he
had to open up the economy due to the pressure from IMF. That was when decolonization started gradually. However, during 
Mon Mohan Singh's tenure, the policy paralysis dragged the country back. It is an irony that the person touted as the 
chief architect of economic liberalization under PV Narshima Rao was the head of a paralytic regime during the UPA rules.
India witnessed a sluggish growth inspite of policy paralysis and the "coalition compulsion". Being an egineer or a doctor 
is perceived as a great achievement for a person in the period. Multi-national companies recruited undergraduates from IITs
with salary package that far exceeded even the professors who taught them. The parents wanted to see their children as 
doctors or engineers. Media emphasis on high salaries originated from that societal aspirations. The mass media in India
unfortunately focuses on wrong issues with sole aim of better TRP and viewerships. It does create a public perception 
about getting admissions into IITs.  A successful doctor can earn many times more than the salary of even a highly
paid engineer from IIT. However, doctors require at least 5-10 years to become successful whereas an engineer's success
depends on the placement after graduation. But getting into an IIT is more challenging than getting into a medical
school. 

I disagree with the fourth point in Prof Ramgopal's article. Lack of resources for expansion is a myth created by government
of the day. It opened up education sector to private player without a proper planning. Engineering colleges were regulated
by AICTE. However, an honest educationist would know about the role of AICTE. I don't wish to go into it in futher details. 
AICTE created a set of impractical guidelines, perhaps deliberately. Ultimately, backdoor recoginition system operated from
AICTE made expert evaluation redundant eyewash. it is the politicians who called shots in controling engineering education. 
It created a large pool of unemployable engineering graduates. Now we find many colleges are forced to shutdown their operations. 

Prof Ramgopal gives following four recommendations for revamping education system:

- Top-tier institution expansion
- Study now-pay later schemes
- Transparency in reporting pay packages
- Reviving state universities

The author's idea of expansion is limited to top-tier institutes producing large number of Ph. Ds. Prof Ramgopal hopes
the graduate students can create a large-pool of well-trained people who can help raise the standard of teaching in
second-tier institutions. I think the author is missing the point that both undergraduate and graduate studies are
interlinked. Input to graduate studies even in top-tier institution would be from bottom-tier institutions where
resources are limited and teachers are ill-trained. Midocre inputs will create midiocre output. So, quality of Ph. D
programmes at top-tier institute would not improve in short-term. Rather, I have seen its quality deteroriate. 

I would say even school education system is linked to undergraduate education. Govt schools are in real
tatters. Except of Kendriya Vidyalays, schools aided by state governments are in real bad shape. In fact, I understand
many state governments are either closing down these schools or in the process of doing so.
[One of my old blogs](./stateOfSchoolEducation.md) deals with state of govt schoosl in Jharkhand. There is another 
aspect of problem of quality in our education system. Indian education system places a lot of emphasis on learning by rote.
It equips the students with a sort of content addressable memory. The students are not trained in the art of problem 
solving. Our evaluation system is completely relies on the performance in the written examinations. Of course, we
rely on sensory perception a lot in knowledge acquistion, but cognitive abilties remain under developed without
without a drill on problem solving skills.

Sponsoring education of a child is complicated social issue. Study-now-pay later had been tried and tested. It is not
a mere problem of government guarantee for financing. Granting loans would quickly turn into an elimination process
where nearly 50 million aspirants seek higher education. Even we assume only 10% seek loans, it would amount to
nearly 5-6 million dollars of NPA every year. Can we really afford it? Freebies are already [eating away close to 20%
of revenue receipts](./anonymousDonor.md) of many state governments.

Tranparency in reporting pay package is another of the Prof Ramgopal's recommendations. I don't think it is a big issue. People
in peer groups understand the reality. Intrinsically, a human life has to deal with  inequalities. But the next recommendation
is definitely worth examining. Reviving state run universities is to make them truly autonomous. State Universities 
operate under the tight control of state governments. All regional parties ruling the state governments operate with single
point agenda for filling party's coeffer. Even a small political party controls enough resources to establish 5-10 IITs. 
They are in business of retaining power by hook or crook. Meddling of governments and parties in the affairs of universities
is obnoxiously voilent and they often resort to stifling saner voices by blocking flow of funds to university. Students
unions are highly politicized. I think clearing such a mess is beyond herculean task unless universities compartmentalize
their operations. Politices has its roots in HSS and subjects where placements are hard to come by.
