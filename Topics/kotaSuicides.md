# Killing Factories of Kota!

I came across two articles recently touching various issues including lack of quality education in context of series of suicides
of aspirants registered in different coaching centers operating from Kota. Kota is a town in Rajasthan known for its coaching 
centers. In past, there have been numerous half-hearted attempts to curb coaching activities. Socialogist, politicians and 
educationists have denounced coaching a malady. Two netflix series "kota factory" and prime video "crash course" have been quite 
popular depicting facets of aspirants lives in private hostels their interactions with coaching centrs. Unfortunately, no one 
dares to touch the root cause for the operation of the entire echo-system related to coaching at Kota, Vizag, New Delhi, 
Kanpur, Lucknow, and Ranchi or elsewhere in the country. About 100k students are enrolled every year in different coaching
centers at Kota. It records three suicides per month in average or 30-35 suicides per year. The figures for other cities are
unknown. But I guess the average rate may be slightly lower among sspirants at different cities or towns. It might be due to 
various reasons including unorganized small coaching centers at other cities where level of aspiration is lower among the 
peer groups. 

Let us start with a bit of figures explaining thriving coaching business.  The number of aspirants in JEE Mains is
about 900.5k, and approximately 2000.5k in NEET. So, we are talking about 31 lacs aspirants. The number of seats is 100k
for NEET qualified students, and 39k in JEE Mains. JEE advance offers 17k whereas AIIMS offers only 2k seats. Some of the
other well known medical collages in India are: KGM Lucknow, JIPMER Puduchery, PGIMER Chandigarh, Kasturba Medical College 
Manipal, JNMC Aligarh, SRMC Chennai, GSVMMC Kanpur, SCBMC Cuttack and few others. Though there are 612 medical colleges, 
48k seats are in govt run colleges. We know about 20k medical students were evacuated when Ukraine war started. About 5k 
students go every year to China for medical studies. That makes about 25-30k students going to foreign countries for MBBS 
degrees each year. Though it is an unbalanced comparison, we are talking about 310k aspirants who compete for only 
65k (17k engineering + 48k medical) seats. The overall success rate is 4.7%. In plain terms only 47 out of every 1000 
aspirants are successful. If we talk about NEET, the success rate drops to 0.02%.

Prof Ramgopal (Ex Director of IIT Delhi) wrote [an oped in ToI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/what-the-kota-factory-suicides-say-about-our-education-system/).
He links the problem to our education system. I agree with the assessment though there are some areas where I disagree 
his analysis and recommendations. Let me first deal with agreement part. The article speaks of five key issues. 

- Imbalance in demand-supply ratio
- Disparity between top and other institutions
- Media emphasis on high salaries
- Lack of resources for expansion
- Rising lower middle-class aspirations

I have already talked about the first two points in terms of figures. An overall success rate of 4.7% is a pathetic commentry
on Indian policy makers and planners. I believe politicians deliberately prevented the access to education to general
public in fear of losing their clout. I would term it as a colonial mind-set. In 1991, when PV Narshima Rao became PM, he
had to open up the economy due to the pressure from IMF. That is when decolonization started gradually. However, during 
Mon Mohan Singh's tenure, the policy paralysis dragged the country back. It is an irony that the person touted as the 
chief architect of economic liberalization under PV Narshima Rao was the head of a paralytic regime during the UPA rules.
India witnessed a sluggish growth inspite of policy paralysis and the "coalition compulsion". Being an egineer or a doctor 
is perceived as a great achievement for a person in the period. Multi-national companies recruited undergraduates from IITs
with salary package that far exceeded even the professors who taught them. The parents wanted to see their children as 
doctors or engineers. Media emphasis on high salaries originated from that societal aspirations. The mass media in India
unfortunately focuses on wrong issue with TRP and viewerships. It does create a public perception about getting admissions
into IITs. The irony of the fact is that a successful doctor can earn many times more than the salary of even a highly paid 
engineer from IIT. 

I disagree with the fourth point in Prof Ramgopal's article. Lack of resources for expansion is a myth created by government
of the day. It opened up education sector to private player without a proper planning. Engineering colleges were regulated
by AICTE. However, the role of AICTE was well known. I don't wish to go into it in futher details. AICTE created a set of
impractical guidelines, perhaps deliberately for the private sponsorers to seek AICTE recognition employing political 
influences. Ultimately, it is the politicians who called shots in controling engineering education. It created a large
pool of unemployable engineering graduates. Now we find many colleges are forced to shutdown their operations. 

Prof Ramgopal gives following four recommendations for revamping education system:

- Top-tier institution expansion
- Study now-pay later schemes
- Transparency in reporting pay packages
- Reviving state universities

The author's idea of expansion is limited to top-tier institutes producing large number of Ph. Ds. Prof Ramgopal hopes
the graduate students can create a large-pool of well-trained people who can help raise the standard of teaching in
second-tier institutions. I think the author is missing the point that both undergraduate and graduate studies are
interlinked. I would say even school education system is linked to undergraduate education. Govt schools are in real
tatters. Except of KVs state govt aided schools are in real bad shape. [One of my old blogs](./stateOfSchoolEducation.md)
deals with it. I see the problem differently. Indian education system places a lot of emphasis on learning by rote.
It equips the students with a sort of content addressable memory. The students are not trained in the art of problem 
solving. Our evaluation system is completely relies on the performance in the written examinations.

I remember Chandra Babu Naidu became CM of undivided AP during 1995-1999. He started initiative to create multiple opportunities
in AP especially in IT and Telecom sectors. The chief architect of this initiative was 






 One thing is clear that there cannot be any short-cut
to success. The society measure the success in terms of money, because money buys comforts and friends.
