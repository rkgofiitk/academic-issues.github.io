# Killing Factories of Kota!

[Blog Index](../index.md)

I recently found two articles touching on various issues, including the lack of quality education in a series of suicides
of aspirants registered in different coaching centers operating from Kota. [One of the articles](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/what-the-kota-factory-suicides-say-about-our-education-system/) 
by Prof V. Ramgopal Rao, VC of BIT Pilani. It goes a bit into the issues that require more analysis. 
[The other article](https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2023/09/suicides-in-kota-students-need-career.html?m=1) by Prof Dheeraj Sanghi, 
VC of JKLU, Jaipur. Dheeraj was my colleague at IIT Kanpur. His views on the education system in general and career 
counseling advice to IIT JEE qualifiers are well respected. I don't know Prof Ramgopal personally, but I have seen his post 
from time to time since he became the Director of IIT Delhi from 2016 to 2022. 

Kota is a town in Rajasthan known for its coaching centers. In the past, there have been numerous attempts to curb coaching 
activities. Significant changes in "IIT JEE" were administered by Kapil Sibal MHRD in the first UPA cabinet with an apparent
target of reducing the menace of Coaching centers. Sociologists, politicians, and educationists have denounced coaching as a
malady without fully addressing the root cause of capacity expansion. Two popular TV series, "Kota Factory" (Netflix) and 
"Crash Course" (Amazon Prime) depict facets of the lives of young aspirants in private hostels and their interactions with 
teachers of coaching centers. They also bring out the socio-economic issues that affect the lives of India's middle-class people 
in their quest for cherished aspirations. Both the articles mentioned above talk about scaling issues from the point of view 
of engineering education. Dheeraj's article goes deeper with some facts and figures and points to the "curse of scaling." 
It also speaks of other comparable options to the parents for their wards.

The coaching centers are in Kota and other major cities like Vizag, New Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Hyderabad,
and Ranchi. However, with an annual enrollment of 200k, Kota beats them all. It records three suicides per month on average or 30-35 
suicides per year. The figures for other cities have not been reported. But I guess the average rate of suicides 
may be slightly lower among aspirants in different cities or towns. It might be due to various reasons, including unorganized 
small coaching centers in other cities where the level of aspiration is lower among the peer groups. 

Let us start with a bit of figures explaining the thriving coaching business. The number of aspirants in JEE Mains is
about 900.5k, and approximately 2000.5k in NEET. So, we are talking a little over 2900k aspirants. The number of seats is 100k
for NEET-qualified students and 39k in JEE Mains. JEE Advance offers 17k, whereas AIIMS offers only 2k seats. Some of the
other well-known medical collages in India are KGM Lucknow, JIPMER Puducherry, PGIMER Chandigarh, Kasturba Medical College 
Manipal, JNMC Aligarh, SRMC Chennai, GSVMMC Kanpur, SCBMC Cuttack, etc. Though there are 612 medical colleges, 
48k seats are in government colleges. We know about 20k medical students were evacuated when the Ukraine war started. About 5k 
students go every year to China for medical studies. That makes about 25-30k students go to foreign countries for MBBS 
degrees yearly. Though it is an unbalanced comparison, we are talking about 2900k aspirants who compete for only 
65k (17k engineering + 48k medical) seats. The overall success rate is 2.2%. In plain terms, only about 2 out of every 100 
aspirants are successful. For engineering admission, the success rate is 1.9%.

Prof Ramgopal links the problem to our education system. I agree with this part of his assessment, though there are some areas 
where I have to disagree with his analysis and recommendations. Let me first deal with the agreement part. 
The article speaks of five key issues. 

- Imbalance in the demand-supply ratio
- Disparity between the top and other institutions
- Media emphasis on high salaries
- Lack of resources for expansion
- Rising lower middle-class aspirations

I have already talked about the first two points in terms of figures. An overall success rate of 2.2% is a pathetic comment
on Indian policymakers and planners. Politicians deliberately prevent access to education to the general
public for fear of losing their clouts. It is a colonial mindset. In 1991, when PV Narshima Rao became PM, he
had to open up the economy due to pressure from the IMF. That was when decolonization started gradually. However, during 
Mon Mohan Singh's tenure, the policy paralysis dragged the country back. Ironically, the person touted as the 
chief architect of economic liberalization under PV Narshima Rao was the head of a paralytic regime during the UPA rules.
India witnessed sluggish growth despite policy paralysis and what the then PM termed as "coalition compulsion." Being an 
engineer or a doctor is perceived as a great achievement for a young person in that period. Multi-national companies 
recruited undergraduates from IITs with salary packages that far exceeded even the professors who taught them. The parents
wanted to see their children as doctors or engineers. Media emphasis on high salaries originated from societal aspirations.
Unfortunately, the mass media in India focuses on the wrong issues with the sole aim of better TRP and viewership. It does 
create a public perception about getting admissions into IITs. A successful doctor can earn more than a highly paid engineer
from IIT. However, doctors require at least 5-10 years to succeed, whereas an engineer's success
depends on the placement after graduation. But getting into an IIT is more challenging than a medical school. 

I have to disagree with the fourth point in Prof. Ramgopal's article. The lack of resources for expansion is a myth created 
by the government of the day. It opened up the education sector to private players who needed proper planning. AICTE regulated
engineering colleges. However, an honest educationist would know about the role of AICTE. I wish to avoid going into it 
in further detail. AICTE created a set of impractical guidelines, perhaps deliberately. Ultimately, the backdoor recognition 
system operated from AICTE made the expert evaluation a redundant eyewash. It is the politicians who call the shots 
in controlling engineering education. It created a large pool of unemployable engineering graduates. Now, we find many colleges
are forced to shut down their operations. 

Prof Ramgopal gives the following four recommendations for revamping the education system:

- Top-tier institution expansion
- Study now-pay later schemes
- Transparency in reporting pay packages
- Reviving state universities

The author's idea of expansion is limited to top-tier institutes producing a large number of Ph. Ds. Prof Ramgopal hopes
the graduate students can create a large pool of well-trained people who can help raise the standard of teaching in
second-tier institutions. The author misses the point that undergraduate and graduate studies are intertwined. Inputs to 
graduate studies, even in top-tier institutions, would be from bottom-tier institutions with limited resources, and teachers
need to be better trained. Midocre inputs are destined to create mediocre output. So, the quality of Ph. D
programs at top-tier institutes would not improve in the short term. Instead, I have seen its quality deteriorate in my
limited experience. The requirements for qualifiers were reduced to the point where they became redundant. Candidate
failing in viva did not matter. That is an unfortunate reality of boosting the Ph. Ds without thinking about downstream
input.

Even the school education system is linked to undergraduate education. Govt schools are in real
tatters. Except for Kendriya Vidyalaya, schools aided by state governments are in bad shape. I understand
many state governments are either closing down these schools or in the process of doing so.
[One of my old blogs](./stateOfSchoolEducation.md) deals with the state of govt schools in Jharkhand. There is another 
aspect of the problem of quality in our education system. Indian education system places a lot of emphasis on learning by rote.
It equips the students with a content-addressable memory. The students need to be trained in the art of problem-solving. Our 
evaluation system entirely relies on the performance in the written examinations. Of course, we
rely on sensory perception a lot in knowledge acquisition, but cognitive abilities still need a drill on problem-solving skills.

Sponsoring the education of a child is a complicated social issue. Study-now-pay later had been tried and tested. It is not
a mere problem of government guarantee for financing. Granting loans would quickly become an elimination process
where nearly 50 million aspirants seek higher education. Even if we assume only 10% seek loans, it would amount to
nearly 5-6 million dollars of NPA annually. Can we afford it? Freebies are already [eating away close to 20%
of revenue receipts](./anonymousDonor.md) of many state governments.

Transparency in reporting pay packages is another of Prof. Ramgopal's recommendations. It isn't a big issue. People
in peer groups understand the reality. Intrinsically, human life has to deal with inequalities. But the next recommendation
is worth examining. Reviving state-run universities is to make them genuinely autonomous. State Universities 
operate under the tight control of state governments. All regional parties ruling the state governments work with a single-point 
agenda to fill the party's coffers. Even a tiny political party controls enough resources to establish 5-10 IITs. 
They are in the business of retaining power by "hook or crook." The meddling of governments and parties in the affairs
of universities is obnoxiously violent, and they often resort to stifling saner voices by blocking the flow of funds 
to universities. Student unions are highly politicized. Clearing such a mess is beyond herculean unless universities 
compartmentalize their operations. Politics has deep roots in HSS and subjects where placements take time. 
I would recommend five sets of universities:

- Universities for Engineering and science
- Universities for medical sciences
- Universities for management and administration
- Universities for HSS
- Universities for law

The experiment being suggested is familiar. The successes of IITs, IIMs, AIIMs, Ashoka, and NCLs are apparent to us. 
Education should be removed from the state list altogether. The concurrent list also has muddled the peaceful environment of 
even reputed educational institutes in many states. A few states even trying to block implementation of the National
Education Policy. A few state govts making attempts to lower the level of competition among students by opposing all 
India entrance examinations to professional courses in state universities. Resources for centrally funced institutions
can be generated by using state share of GST in proporationate to education. Provide enough legistative protections to 
the educational institutions to prevent meddling by state govt backed politicians. I am not saying all state level
politicians are bad and corrupt, but their allegiance to the regional parties blurr their broader vision for anything notable
they may wish to do for their constituency.
