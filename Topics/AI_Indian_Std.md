I think he has a point in saying what he said. Indian tech companies have expertise to build LLM tool like ChatGPT. 
However, a project to build an LLM tool is prohibitively expensive and the real challenge lies in making the tool scalable 
and affordable. 

Many commentators have painted bleak scenarios about job losses due to increasing use of AI enabled tools, we have not yet seen 
much of its impact in Indian context. AI's impacts until now have been restricted in secretarial assistances, education, healthcare,
investment marketing with human hand-holding. Asistance of AI tools has improved capabilities of average human worker. Indian
government has started speding heavily in digital infrastructure since 2020 after Covid-19 outbreak. Work from home, and relying on
contract based jobs reduced cost to companies. However, many companies did not think work from home is a great idea. It allowed
many employee to moonshine working for many simultaneous jobs on contract. At individual level, managers and team leaders found
that the employees ran into time management affecting productivity. Only service industry grew during Covid-19 while manufacturing 
sector suffered heavy losses. Government efforts to keep economy afloat through extensive use of telecommunication and digital 
infrastructure led to invasion of even bedrooms and restroom of employees created an added schism in conflict in employee-employer

moonshining.The employees, on the other hand, were upset due to rampant unchecked invasion of personal space by the employers.

retrieval augmented generation (RAG) which combines the strength of LLM with context sensitive, precise knowledge. It will help
struggling employees to meet the job requirements and at the same time make the employers happy with workforce. The government 
efforts are directed to accept the reality and work towards a win-win scenario. Though the idea is to raise the happiness 
quotient of citizens,
