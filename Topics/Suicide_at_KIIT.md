# # Suicides in Private Educational Institutions 

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Many of us are concerned about the suicides of students due to academic pressures at top institutions in India. The spate of suicides 
in Kota dismayed us at the loss of talented young lives earlier last year. Recently, a suicide at one of the IoEs in the Private
sector raised a diplomatic row between India and Nepal. At first instance, it appears like an unfortunate case of abetment to suicide 
of a young student. The sad event could have been prevented if the Institute's International  Relations Office handled the complaint 
quickly and sensibly. 

Initially, I  misread KIIT as IITK. However, I soon realized it was not IITK but an institution of eminence (IoE) called KIIT. The 
institution is situated in Bhubaneswar, a picturesque small city in the eastern part of India in Odisha. The institution was 
accorded IoE status in September 2017. Interestingly, IITK is still not an IoE. The criteria that the Ministry of Education uses to 
grant IoE status remains a mystery to me, as well as scores of others. However, the IoE status of an institution is not the subject 
of discussion here.  We are concerned with the management of private institutions. All the private institutions come under the 
respective states where they are located. KIIT, being in Odisha, comes under the state of Odisha and, therefore, under the 
administrative control of the Odisha Government. India's education ministry is also currently headed by Mr. Dharmendra Pradhan, 
who hails from Odisha too. An independent observer will naturally draw a connection between KIIT and the Ministry of Education. 
Asking rhetorically, one would like to say: Mr. Minister, do you even know what is happening in your state?

I won't say that I am fully aware of the case of suicide at KIIT except for the reportage of the incident and the subsequent related
events on mass and social media. Even if 30% of the reports are correct, I think both the governments at the center and the state 
should be worried and straighten things once and for all. The most disconcerting facts are two widely circulated videos where
- Two lady teachers are abusing students
- Criminal attacks on students by both security and hired criminals.

One of the lady teachers is seen threatening the female students that if they don't leave the KIIT campus, they will be evicted by the
police. That may imply that KIIT authorities are confident that the state will bail them out of protests without attracting
punitive consequences. The other lady teacher declared that Nepal's year budget could not match KIIT's annual 
budget. The arrogance is on full display in public. The two teachers have tendered scripted apologies as the incident snowballed
into a diplomatic row after the PM of Nepal posted on X and decided to despatch two officers from the New Delhi Embassy. 

It is pathetic and even surprising to know that the incidents of beating students, forcibly herding them into buses, and dumping them 
at railway stations at Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, and Puri did not attract the Odisha government's attention. It is a botched job by
KIIT and the government of Odisha. I wonder how the minister of education remains unaware of the happenings, more so as he
hails from the same state. It shows either rank incompetence or utter disregard for the rule of law. 

The other serious issue is the investigation of suicide. Many reports say that the victim had lodged numerous complaints of 
harassment to the International Relations Office of the institution. It becomes obligatory for the IRO to report the matter to the 
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). I am not sure if KIIT even has an ICC. If that is the case, the entire Institute is guilty 
of abetments to suicide along with the involved persons. 

The victim's body was removed from the room, and the police reportedly did not receive any call until it was late. I am not 
prejudging anything at the moment. However, as we know, investigating agencies act according to the government's wishes. The 
other important angle is the display of racial abuse in the aftermath of the incident of unfortunate suicide. Press and television
in India pick up every incident of racial violations against Indians in the US, Europe, Australia, and China. However, I did 
not understand why they did not raise much noise about the racial abuse of young Nepalese citizens in Odisha. Normalizing 
racial abuses in India at Educational institutions is equally distasteful. It is time for the government of Odisha and the 
Federal Ministry of Education to enforce the legal framework of control over private institutions strictly.
