# Suicides in Private Educational Institutions 

We have been talking about suicides of students due to academic pressures at top institutions in India. The spate of suicides in
Kota raised lot of dismay at the loss of talented young lives in earlier last year. Recently a suicide at one of IoE in Private
sector raised a deplomatic row between India an Nepal. Initially, misreading KIIT as IITK, it attracted my attention. However,
I soon realized it is not IITK but an institution of eminence (IoE) called KIIT. The institution is situated at Bhubaneswar,
a picturesque city in eastern part of India in state of Odisha. The institution was accorded IoE status in September, 2017. 
Interestingly, IITK is still not an IoE. What are the criteria used by Ministry of Education for granting IoE status was a mistery
and not the subject matter of discussion here. We are concerned with the management of private institutions. All the private
institutions come under the respective states where they are located. KIIT being in Odisha comes under the state of Odisha, therefore,
under the administrative control of Odisa Government. India education ministry is also currently headed by Mr. Dharmendra Pradhan
who hails from Odisha too. An independent observer will naturally draw a connection between KIIT and the ministry of Education.

I won't say that I am fully aware of the case of suicide at KIIT except from the reportage of the incident and the subsequent related
events on mass and social media. Even if 30% of the reports are correct, I think both the governments at the center and the state 
should be worried and straignten things once for all. Most disconcerting facts are two widely circulated videos where
- Two lady teachers are abusing students
- Criminal attacks on students by both security and hired criminals.

One of the lady teacher is seen to threaten the girl students that if they don't leave KIIT campus they will be evicted by the
police. That may imply that KIIT authorities are confident about state bailing them out of any protests without attracting any
punitive consequences. The other lady teacher went as far as declaring Nepal's year budget cannot even match KIIT's annual 
buget. The arrogance is in full display in public. The two teachers have tenddered scripted apology as the incident snowballed
into a diplomatic row after PM of Nepal posted on X and dicided to despatch two officers from New Delhi Embassy. 

It is really pathetic to know that the incidents of beating students, forcibly herding them into buses and dumping at railway
stations at Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and Puri Railway did not attract Odisha government's attention. It is a botched up job by
KIIT and the government of Odisha. I wonder how the ninister of education remain unaware of the happeninges, more so, as he
hails from the same state. It shows either incompetence or total disregard to rule of law. 

The other serious issue of the investigation of suicide case. If anything about the victim bringing the case of harassments
to the notice of ICC or Internation Students Relation Unit of the institution is correct then the entire institute is guilty
of abetments to suicide along with those involved. The victim's body was removed from the room and the police reportedly
did not receive any call until it was late. I am not prejudging anything at the modemnt. However, as we know investigating
agencies act according to wishes of the government. The other important angle is the display of racial abuse in the aftermath of
the incident of unfortunate suicide. Press and television in India pick up every incident of racial violations against Indians 
in US, Europe, Australia, and China. However, I did not understand why they did not raise much noise in racial abuse of young
Nepalese citizens in Odisha. Normalizing racial abuses in India at Educational institutions is equally distasteful. It is time
that government of Odisha and Minstry of Education should seriously enforce legal framework of control over every private
institutions.
