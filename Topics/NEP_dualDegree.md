## Unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE

In an interview to a Times of India reporter, the UGC chairperson disclosed that a committee has been formed
for [unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE](https://am.linkedin.com/posts/mamidala-jagadesh-kumar-76b090146_manash-gohain-of-times-of-india-writes-the-activity-6896151745542901760-HVLe?trk=public_profile_like_view) to streamline the domain of higher education. It is not clear how the proposed unification may speed up or facilitate the
implementation of new National Education Policy. Govt is apparently working on a bill to create a new unified 
regulatory agency called HECI (Higher Education Commission of India). The bill may be introduced in the parliament's
upcoming winter session. As I understand the three bodies UGC, AICTE and NCTE will preserve their own identities 
within the framework of HECI. The umbrella body is going to perform the role of coordination over the three agencies.
It will make sure that no conflicting views are presented in public. Before dealing with the existing conflicts among
the regulatory agencies, let us step back a bit to understand the broad roles of the three agencies in the domain of 
higher education.

- UGC is a regulatory agency for overseeing the role of universities.
- AICTE is responsible for evolving standards of techinical eduation.
- NCTE is responsible for in developing a framework of educating the educators.

There are a few overlapping areas where three agencies may have their own set of guidelines or controls. However,
NCTE's role is passive, it is not directly connected with the domain of higher education. Its primary responsibility
is for designing curriculum for training and upgrading skills of school teachers. Admittedly, the roles of school
teachers are very critical considering they influence kids early on shaping up their learning capabilities and 
background knowledge that will prepare them for higher education. 

AICTE defines guidelines for the selection and assessment-based progress of faculty in technical education. It also
defines the broad contours of a technical institutions including the requirements of labs, libraries and student
facilities. AICTE has no jurisdiction over universities or even deemed universities. However, many universities 
also offer Undergraducate and Postrgaduate prorammes in engineering and other technical certifications. So, 
the requirements for standardization of technical education forces AICTE and UGC to have some sort of broad 
agreements in many areas in the domain of higher education. 

IIT system is by and large has remained free from interferences of the principal regulatory agencies until now.
Compared to the state or the central universities, the IITs excelled and recognized world over for their undergraducates
programmes in engineering. Some odd UGC Chairpersons did try to exercise their control over IIT system in the 
past by sending out its missives from time to time. However, IITs have succeeded in ignoring them effectively. 
So, though the conflicts did arise from time to time, all three bodies were happy to leave things at a 
level where confrontation were avoided over non-compliance issues by the IITs in the past. Clearly, the govt's 
intentions is to bring the non-compliance to the forefront in a bid to achieve standardization in higher
education. Otherwise, I don't see a reason for creation of an umbrella agency like HECI. I am not sure what 
will be the exact role of HECI with respect to IIT system. IITs are governed by IIT Council, I am not sure if 
HECI may influence IIT council in its decision making or any IITs will still be allowed to ignore HECI like 
they did to UGC. 

The question for now is that whether HECI becomes a body like Niti ayog, or a commission of compliances like SEBI
or even TRAI. We should wait and watch how HECI shapes up to become a fulfledged controling plus standardization
agency and what comes under its ambit. However, in my humble opinion the compliance issue is going to be hard 
problem to manage. Firstly, education belong to the concurrent list. According to an [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_India)
the break up of institutes of higher learning are as follows:

- 416 state universities
- 126 deemed universities with majority of them being under the control of states
- 54 central universities
- 159 institutes of national importance that includes IITs, AIIMS, IISER, NITs, IIEST, and few others.

Central universities have not fared much better than many state universities. Even UoH, DU or JNU have their
fair share of disturbances and controversies. University system as whole has come under
a fair dose of agititional interference by "intelligentia" using the surrogacy through the students. 
The so called intelligentia have been by and large were successful creating dissary in university education 
system. I am not sure why they do that and how their doings makes people aware of the disparities in 
socio-economic conditions of the poor. However, their own political existence is secured at the expense of
the gullible surrogate pawns (students). It could be a billion dollar question to answer, whether or not 
the state political aparatus will submit to HECI's standardization initiatives in respect of the state universities? 

Ninety percent of private universities game the system and are least bothered about standard in higher education.
For these institution cash flow is all that matters. They typically want a 15-20% returns on investments and
perhaps further their political ambitions. There is only a handful of private universities such as BITS, ISB, 
Ashoka, XLRI which were able to maintain some sort of standards because of their long legacy. It will take 
huge time and efforts for other private universities to attend level of maturity to preserve the standard of
their institutions. So it is left only 159 institutes of national importance that can sustain and upgrade 
standards of Indian technical education system. Already, the govt has succeeded in drafting many unwanted
educationist of questionable credentials as the heads of these institutions. If HECI tries to throttle compliance
issue on these institutions then we are doomed.


The government efforts in creating regulatory bodies of NAAC have not paid off. NAAC is gamed by private
universities. A [recent report in ToI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/better-than-the-best-naacs-grade-discrepancies-under-lens/articleshow/94591794.cms) and an [editorial post](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/unreliably-a-oddities-in-naac-assessment-call-for-an-urgent-audit-dont-mess-with-higher-education/) 
say that a deemed private university in Bhubaneswar has been awarded the
highest ever NAAC accreditation score. There are seven other private universities including on engineering college
in Bangulur which scored higher NAAC scores than 3.67 scored by IISc Bangalore. In NIRF ranking IISc is 1st
and the aforesaid Engineering College of Bangaluru is at the band of 175-200 NIRF ranks. NIRF ranking depends on 
certain structured data on research, students enrollments, academic programes, facilities and also the 
perception ranking by eminent educationists.  Perhaps the scope of manipulation of these data is low. Any system
of human intervenation can be gamed. Like they say everyone has a price.
