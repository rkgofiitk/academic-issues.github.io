## Unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE

In an interview with a Times of India reporter, the UGC chairperson disclosed that a committee had been formed
for the [unification of UGC, AICTE, and NCTE](https://am.linkedin.com/posts/mamidala-jagadesh-kumar-76b090146_manash-gohain-of-times-of-india-writes-the-activity-6896151745542901760-HVLe?trk=public_profile_like_view) to streamline the domain of higher education. It is unclear how the proposed unification may speed up or facilitate the
implementation of the new National Education Policy. Govt is working on a bill to create a new unified 
regulatory agency called HECI (Higher Education Commission of India). The bill may be introduced in the parliament's
upcoming winter session. As I understand, the three bodies, UGC, AICTE, and NCTE, will preserve their own identities 
within the framework of HECI. The umbrella body will perform the role of coordination over the three agencies.
It will make sure that no conflicting views are presented in public. Before dealing with the existing conflicts among
the regulatory agencies, let us step back a bit to understand the broad roles of the three agencies in the domain of 
higher education.

- UGC is a regulatory agency overseeing the role of universities.
- AICTE is responsible for evolving standards of technical education.
- NCTE is responsible for developing a framework for educating educators.

Three agencies may have guidelines or controls in a few overlapping areas. However,
NCTE's role is passive. It is not directly connected with the domain of higher education. Its primary responsibility
is designing curricula for training and upgrading the skills of school teachers. Admittedly, the roles of school
teachers are critical, considering they influence kids early on, shaping their learning capabilities and 
background knowledge that will prepare them for higher education. 

AICTE defines guidelines for the selection and assessment-based progress of faculty in technical education. It also
describes the broad contours of technical institutions, including the requirements of labs, libraries, and student
facilities. AICTE has no jurisdiction over universities or even deemed universities. However, many universities 
also offer Undergraduate and Postgraduate prorammes in engineering and other technical certifications. So, 
the requirements for standardization of technical education force AICTE and UGC to have some broad 
agreements in many areas of higher education. 

The IIT system, by and large, has remained free from interference from the principal regulatory agencies until now.
Compared to the state or central universities, the IITs excelled and are recognized worldwide for their engineering undergraduate programs. Some odd UGC Chairpersons did try to exercise their control over the IIT system by sending out  missives from time to time. However, IITs have succeeded in ignoring them effectively. 
So, though conflicts arose occasionally, all three bodies were happy to leave things at a 
level where confrontations were avoided in the past. I am not sure if 
HECI may influence the IIT council in its decision-making, or any IITs will still be allowed to ignore HECI as 
they did to UGC. 

The government intends to bring non-compliance to the forefront to achieve standardization in higher
education. Otherwise, I don't see a reason for creating an umbrella agency like HECI. The question is whether HECI
becomes a body like Niti ayog or a commission of compliances like SEBI or even TRAI. We have to wait and watch
how HECI shapes up to become a full-fledged controlling plus standardization agency and what comes under its ambit. 
However, the compliance issue is going to be hard problem to manage due to many reasons. 

The education belongs to the concurrent list. According to an [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_India)
the break up of institutes of higher learning are as follows:

- 416 state universities
- 126 deemed universities, with the majority of them being under the control of states
- 54 central universities
- 159 institutes of national importance include IITs, AIIMS, IISER, NITs, IIEST, and a few others.

Central universities have not fared much better than many state universities. Even UoH, DU, or JNU have their
fair share of disturbances and controversies. The University system has come under agitational interference by "intelligentsia" using surrogacy through the students. 
The so-called intelligentsia has been, by and large, successful in creating disarray in the university education 
system. I am not sure why they do that and how their doings make people aware of the disparities in 
the socio-economic conditions of the poor. However, their political existence is secured at the expense of
the unsuspecting surrogate pawns (students). It could be a billion-dollar question to answer whether or not 
the state political apparatus will submit to HECI's standardization initiatives in respect of the state universities. 

Ninety percent of private universities game the system and are least bothered about higher education standards.
For these institutions, cash flow is all that matters. They typically want 15-20% investment returns and
perhaps further their political ambitions through their institutions. There is only a handful of private 
universities, such as BITS, ISB, Ashoka, and XLRI, were able to maintain some standards because of their 
long legacy. It will take a lot of time and effort for other private universities to attend a level of
maturity to preserve the standard of their institutions. So it is left only 159 institutes of national 
importance can sustain and upgrade the standards of the Indian technical education system. Already, the 
govt has succeeded in drafting many unwanted educationists of questionable credentials as the heads of these 
institutions. If HECI tries to throttle compliance issues in these institutions, then we are doomed.


The government's efforts in creating regulatory bodies of NAAC have not paid off. Private universities game NAAC. 
A [recent report in ToI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/better-than-the-best-naacs-grade-discrepancies-under-lens/articleshow/94591794.cms) and an [editorial post](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/unreliably-a-oddities-in-naac-assessment-call-for-an-urgent-audit-dont-mess-with-higher-education/) 
say that a deemed private university in Bhubaneswar has been awarded the
highest-ever NAAC score. There are seven other private universities, including an engineering college
in Bangulur, which scored higher NAAC scores than the 3.67 scored by IISc Bangalore. In NIRF ranking IISc is 1st
and the aforesaid Engineering College of Bangaluru is in the band of 175-200 NIRF ranks. It proves that 
either NAAC accreditation process is wrong or NIRF ranking is unreliable. However, NIRF ranking depends on 
certain structured data on research, student enrollments, academic programs, facilities, and the 
perception ranking by eminent educationists.  Perhaps the scope of manipulation of these data is low. Any system
that depends on human intervention can be gamed using inducements and coercions. As they say, everyone has a price.
