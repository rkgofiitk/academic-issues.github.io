## Dual Degree Guidelines

A recent news item on ToI which reports that UGC chairperson has formed a committee to recommend unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE to streamline
the domain of higher education. It is not clear what the unification would mean for implementation of new National Education Policy. Govt has 
apparently working on a bill to create a new unified regulatory agency called HECI (Higher Education Commission of India). The bill will be
introduced in the parliament's upcoming winter session. As I understand the three bodies UGC, AICTE and NCTE will preserve their own entity 
within the framework of HECI. The umbrella body is going to perform the role of coordination over the three agencies. It will make sure that
no conflicting views are presented in public. Before dealing with the existing conflict among the regulatory agencies, let us step back a bit to
understand the roles of the three agencies in the domain of higher education.

- UGC is largely a regulatory agency for overseeing the role of universities.
- AICTE is responsible for evolving standards of techinical eduation.
- NCTE has a fairly passive role in developing framework for upgradation of faculty.

There are clearly overlapping domains where three agencies may have their own set of guidelines or controls. For example AICTE may have 
some sort of guidelines for the faculty which specifies that a faculty member must have attended or completed a few  NCTE approved refresher 
courses to be eligible for a career assesment-based promotion. Similarly, many universities award technical degrees such as B.Tech, M.Tech.
AICTE may wish to control the curriculum of these academic programs. UGC always wanted to exercise its control over IIT system by sending
out its guidelines. So, there is nothing like a no-man's line in activities of the three agencies. However, all three bodies were happy to
leave things at that level without confrontation flaring up to a punitive actions against non-compliance. Clearly, govt's idea is to kill
this non-compliance from educational institution. Otherwise, I don't see a reason for an umbrella agency like HECI.
