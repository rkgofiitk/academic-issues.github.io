## Unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE

A recent news item on ToI which reports that UGC chairperson has formed a committee to recommend unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE to streamline
the domain of higher education. It is not clear what the unification would mean for implementation of new National Education Policy. Govt has 
apparently working on a bill to create a new unified regulatory agency called HECI (Higher Education Commission of India). The bill will be
introduced in the parliament's upcoming winter session. As I understand the three bodies UGC, AICTE and NCTE will preserve their own entity 
within the framework of HECI. The umbrella body is going to perform the role of coordination over the three agencies. It will make sure that
no conflicting views are presented in public. Before dealing with the existing conflict among the regulatory agencies, let us step back a bit to
understand the roles of the three agencies in the domain of higher education.

- UGC is largely a regulatory agency for overseeing the role of universities.
- AICTE is responsible for evolving standards of techinical eduation.
- NCTE has a fairly passive role in developing framework for educating the educators.

There are a few overlapping areas where three agencies may have their own set of guidelines or controls. However,
NCTE is not directly connected with the domain of higher education. It is primarily responsible for designing 
curriculum for training and upgrading skills of school teachers. Admittedly, the roles of school teachers are very 
important considering they influence kids early on and not only shape up their learning capabilities 
but also have responsibility in building their backgrounds for higher education. So, NCTE may have some indirect
influence on higher education systems. 

AICTE defines guidelines for the selection and assessment-based progress of faculty in technical education. AICTE
has no jurisdiction on universities. But many universities also offer Undergraducate and Postrgaduate prorammes in
engineering and other technication education. So, standardization requirements among technical graduates forces 
AICTE and UGC to have some sort of broad agreements in the area of technical education. 

IIT system is by and large has remained free from UGC interferences until now. Compared to state or central 
universities, the IITs have excelled and recognized world over for their undergraducates programmes in 
engineering. A few UGC Chairpersons have tried to exercise their control over IIT system by sending
out its missives from time to time. However, IITs have ignored them effectively. So, there is nothing like a 
no-man's line in activities of the three agencies. However, all three bodies were happy to leave things at a 
level where confrontation were avoided over non-compliance issues in the past. Clearly, govt's intentions is 
to bring the non-compliance issue to forefront. Otherwise, I don't see a reason for an umbrella agency like 
HECI. I am not sure what will be the exact role of HECI in IIT system. However, IITs are governed by IIT Council, I 
am not sure if HECI may influence IIT council in its decision making. We should wait and watch to see if
HECI becomes a body like Niti ayog, or a commission that ensures no omission in compliances. 

In my humble opinion the compliance issue is going to be hard problem to crack. Firstly, education belong to 
concurrent list. According to an [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_India) the break 
up of institutes of higher learning are as follows:

- 416 state universities
- 126 deemed universities with majority of them being under the control of states
- 54 central universities
- 159 institutes of national importance that includes IITs, AIIMS, IISER, NITs, IIEST, and few others.

Central universities have not fared any better than many state universities. University system as whole has come under
a fare dose of political agititional interference by "intelligentia" through student surrogacy. The so called
intelligentia have been by and large successful creating dissary in university education system. I am not sure why
they do that and how that makes people aware of conditions of suffering masses. In early 70s, the state of 
the universities located across state of West Bengal withessed one of the worst period of upheavel. The result is
there for everyone to see even now. It could be billion dollar question to answer, whether or not the state political 
leaders will submit to HECI's interferences in respect of state universities? Ninety percent of private universities
game the system and are least bothered about standard of education. 

There is only a handful of private universities such as BITS, ISB, Ashoka, XLRI which were able to maintain some
standards because of their long history. It will take huge time and efforts for other private universities to
attend level of maturity to preserve the standard of their institutions. So it is left only 159 institutes of 
national importance which are essentially torch bearer of Indian technical education system.

The government efforts in creating regulatory bodies of NAAC have not paid off.
