## Unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE

A recent news item on ToI which reports that UGC chairperson has formed a committee to recommend unification of UGC, AICTE and NCTE to streamline
the domain of higher education. It is not clear what the unification would mean for implementation of new National Education Policy. Govt has 
apparently working on a bill to create a new unified regulatory agency called HECI (Higher Education Commission of India). The bill will be
introduced in the parliament's upcoming winter session. As I understand the three bodies UGC, AICTE and NCTE will preserve their own entity 
within the framework of HECI. The umbrella body is going to perform the role of coordination over the three agencies. It will make sure that
no conflicting views are presented in public. Before dealing with the existing conflict among the regulatory agencies, let us step back a bit to
understand the roles of the three agencies in the domain of higher education.

- UGC is largely a regulatory agency for overseeing the role of universities.
- AICTE is responsible for evolving standards of techinical eduation.
- NCTE has a fairly passive role in developing framework for educating the educators.

There are overlapping domains where three agencies may have their own set of guidelines or controls. NCTE is not directly connected
with the domain of higher education. It is primarily responsible for designing curriculum for training and upgrading skills of school teachers. 
The roles of school teachers are very important considering they influence kids early on and not only shape up their learning capabilities 
but also have responsibility in building their backgrounds for higher education. AICTE defines guidelines for the selection and 
assessment-based progress of faculty in technical education. AICTE has no jurisdiction on universities. But many universities do offer
Undergraducate and Postrgaduate prorammes in technical education. So, standardization requirements among technical graduates envisage
that AICTE and UGC must have some sort of broad agreements in developing various guidelines and standards for technical education. 

IIT system is by and large remained free from UGC interferences. Compared to state or central universities, the IITs have excelled and
recognized world over for the undergraducates programmes in engineering. UGC always wanted to exercise its control over IIT system by sending
out its missives from time to time. So, there is nothing like a no-man's line in activities of the three agencies. However, all three bodies
were happy to leave things at that level without any confrontation over non-compliance issues. Clearly, govt's intentions is to bring the
non-compliance issue to forefront. Otherwise, I don't see a reason for an umbrella agency like HECI. I am not sure what will be the 
exact role of HECI. Will it be a body like Niti ayog, or a commission that ensures no omission in compliances? 

The compliance issue is going to be hard problem to crack. Firstly, education belong to concurrent list. According to an [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_India)
the break up of institutes of higher learning are as follows:

- 416 state universities
- 126 deemed universities with majority of them being under the control of states
- 54 central universities
- 159 institutes of national importance that includes IITs, AIIMS, IISER, NITs, IIEST, and few others.

Central universities have not fared any better than many state universities. University system as whole has come under a fare does of political
interferences specially from so called "intelligentia" who for some reason have worked against maintaining the standards in institutions of 
higher learning.
