## Storytelling, History, and Literature

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Learning is a continuous process, but maturity is slow. A bit of external staging is necessary for the handshaking between 
the two. It is made possible through the system of school and college syllabi and teachers. The choice of textbooks and the 
selection of teachers are essential cogs in the wheels to build the intellectual capital of a state. The subjects we 
collectively refer to as Humanities and Social Sciences become critical. Humanities refer to history, geography, 
literature, economics, political science, psychology, and philosophy. Gender studies and human rights are also 
considered as parts of Social Sciences. However, History and Literature are more human-centric subjects than others. 

I remember much storytelling by our primary and middle school teachers. Unfortunately, we did not understand its 
effectiveness until it was too late. I believe most of our school teachers were themselves unaware that storytelling is
anything other than babysitting. Most parents also think that way. Grandparents willingly indulge in storytelling for 
their grandchildren. 

Panchatantra, Mahabharata, and Ramayana were all-time favorites among the children. The Ramayana is popular in India and 
many parts of the World, such as Indonesia and Turkey. I prefer Mahabharata more than the Ramayana. However, Mahabharata 
is quite complex, with inter-play of too many plots. There are too many local adaptations of Mahabharata, which often 
creates confusion. Many writers have tried retelling of Ramayana from the modern perspectives. However, I don't believe any 
of those could connect to children's imagination as the original Ramayana tales did. It is a complete package that tells 
about respecting Wisemen (rishis), preserving flora and fauna (forest and animals) by destroying evils (poachers as asuras). 

I tried to narrate a couple of small anecdotes from Ramayan to my daughter when she was a toddler. I used wireless 
communication, remote access, tele-transmission, and laser-guided missiles in my narrations. Though she liked the stories 
initially but quickly lost interest. It may be partly because my way of storytelling was boring or because the prominence 
of modern gadgets made the story weaker. 

R. K. Narayan's book on Ramayana mentions the popularity of the Ramayana tv serial. It created an exciting business model 
in the entertainment space. People in villages pooled money to watch Sunday morning serial on rented TVs running with 
car batteries as electricity had not reached most villages in the 90s. There was even a strike of sanitation workers who
demanded that the government should sponsor TV serial. The power of storytelling is critical to any TV show or a movie.    

History and storytelling are closely related. History without a story becomes uninteresting, dull, and devoid of learning. 
I remember a history teacher in our school. He was not a regular teacher for our class. He used to come as a substitute 
teacher when the regular teacher of our class was not available. We all were excited when he would amble into the class. He 
would tell stories about a fictional character called "Gobara," he created. Gobara means a person who tends to cows.  
Interestingly, his character was an ace detective. I do not know even today why he thought detective stories would be  
interesting to middle school students. But he had perfected the art of storytelling. He made it enjoyable by using earthly 
phrases and sometimes couplets or quotes from well-known literature. Today, when I look back, I feel he exposed the 
students to the philosophy of simple living, high thinking, and the power of deductive reasoning. 

We had another excellent history teacher at high school. He read a lot, and his classes were a real treat for us. Again, I 
think his way of the presentation without chalk and board work was outstanding. He taught us dry topics such as the 
evolution of constitutional monarchy in England, the French revolution, the American war of Independence, and world wars I 
and II, with erudition rarely found among high school teachers. I believe he did not think anything significant about the 
Moghul reign in India or the movement for Indian Independence. But he was passionate about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and 
the Manipur march of the Indian National Army. Of course, the reason for being excited about Subhas Bose; may be because 
Bose had his early schooling in our school (Ravenshaw Collegiate) at Cuttack. His other favorite topic was Chanakya and 
the rule of the Maurya dynasty.  I am not sure if he ever thought of writing a history text himself. He appeared to be 
hurt and devastated when all of us did not perform well in school-leaving exams.
I believe the examiners could not comprehend the finer nuances of historical interpretations given by the students, which
our history teacher influenced. We didn't regret that we scored low marks. Most of us
are still indebted to his history teaching. There was a unanimous decision to honor him during a class reunion recently. 
Now I realize that the history syllabus for the high school texts was non-imaginative and too bland to instill any
learning of the past. I believe memorizing dates and things that the Moghul kings did in terms of establishing memorials 
are a churlish way of representing the history of a great nation.

Another serious problem is school education in literature. Language is the building block of expression, presentation, and
communication. Though the texts and essays were good, we had bad teachers. The emphasis was on rot learning. One of the 
literature teachers recited the poems from the book in a nasal singing tone. It was often an ordeal for us to sit through
his class. On top of it, he usually favored the students with influential parents. I am not sure if my others fellow 
classmates had similar feelings. However, most of our schoolmates did not mention much about him. Another reason to dislike
him is the idiotic punishments a student may get if he expressed any displeasure about school or hostel within his earshot. 
Literature should inculcate learning of communication and expression rather than just reciting poems 
or reading essays. Precis and comprehensions are pretty interesting. I remember an anecdote of my inter-college days. An 
English lecturer in a tutorial class asked us to write a text precis. We returned the answer in the following
tutorial. The lecturer went through my answer, but she could not believe I had written it myself. She was
furious that I was trying to convince her that I had written it. That was the last time I had sincerely written a precis. 
I did not prepare for the English comprehensive test for the university exam and just scraped through.

The history syllabi of schools in India are a subject with the most politicized content. Dishonest writers designed the 
contents to influence the students at an impressionable age as per the directions of the politicians. Fortunately, 
technical content cannot be developed without mathematics. Therefore, neither the bureaucrats nor the politicians can 
influence content development.

PS: Incidentally, the surname of our high school history teacher is Bose.
