# Plagiarism in Research in India

Plagiarism is menace that afflicts research community world-wide and not just limited to India. From time to time reports appear in various channels
in media and social network handles bemoaning the extent of its adverse impacts. Even those who indulge in plagiarism for quick success
are not immune from its adverse impacts. It demotivates the entire research community. The honest people suffer from humiliations that those
who are less endowed quickly reach the pinnacle of fame. On the other hand, the masqueraders often get caught in the act and fail to recover
from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes faster than ascent to fame. Resorting to plagiarism is a lose-lose situation
for the research community as a whole. Unfortunately, the  utility of phrases like as ethics, morality and probity appear to be restricted
to Dictionary of nice words when it concerns human ambitions. The world being an unequal system, the yearning to get noticed has no 
nominal bound. Inculcating nice words act as dampner to the lust for desire. So, it is time to dust out these words from Dictionary and bring 
them in center-stage of our education system.

never wanted to make Bharat their home. They systematically destroy  the country's knowledge cradles like Nalanda, Takshilla, Vikramshilla. 
The great reign of terror only made Indians lose the affinity to ethics and morality when very existence is at stake.
