# Plagiarism in Research in India

Plagiarism is menace that afflicts the research community not only in India but world-wide. From time to time reports appear in various channels
in media and social network handles bemoaning the extent of its adverse impacts. It demotivates the entire research community. Even those who
indulge in plagiarism for quick success are not immune from it. The honest people hard working researchers suffer from humiliations that those
who are less endowed quickly reach the pinnacle of fame. On the other hand, the masqueraders often get caught in the act and fail to recover
from shock after being shamed. Their descent to shame becomes much faster than ascent to fame. So, resorting to plagiarism is a lose-lose situation
for the research community as a whole. Unfortunately, the  utility of phrases like as ethics, morality and probity appear to be restricted
to Dictionary of nice words when it concerns human ambitions. The world being an unequal system, the yearning to get noticed has no 
nominal bound. In India it has reached a proportion not observed in the past. It is time to dust out three words ethics, morality and law
from Dictionary and bring them in center-stage of our education system. 

Histroy of ancient India tells us a different story. Aryabhatta, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, Kanad, Nagarjuna, Bodhayan, Bramhagupta, 
Varahamihira, Kautuliya, Patanjali had made Bharat famous. India was known for its enlighitened thinkers and scholars until 700 AD who flourished
and enriched due to its knowledge centers at ancient universities. The country struggled to withstand the ravages 
of time during 700-1867 AD when the marauders like Muhammed Bin Kassim, Ghengiz Khan, Taimur Lang,  Mahamud Gazni, Mohammad Sha Ghori, and the
Moghuls. Alexander said to have destroyed Takshilla. Baktiyar Khiliji the monstrous general of Mahammad Ghori killed the monks, destroyed
monastry, Nalanda University, its famous library in 1193 AD. The marauders never wanted to make Bharat their home. They understood India's real 
strength came from the ancient knowledge centers. They systematically continued the task of destroying the country's two most well knowledge 
cradles like Nalanda, and Vikramshilla. The great reign of terror only made Indians lose the affinity to ethics and morality when very existence 
is at stake. The revival of education system was brought about by Britishers. By and large British colonizers were tolerant as long as 
their purpoeses were served. They wanted to train people for the administration a large population and a vast country. The current 
system of education in India has British legacy.  old times had little to do with plagiarism short span of time has hightened considerable becausef intense competitions. The short-cuts to get listed in hall fame often lands one
to the hall of shame.
