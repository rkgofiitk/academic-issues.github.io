# Foreign Universities Setting up Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish disclosed in a press conference that "[foreign universities like Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have been
welcomed to set up camp in the country]
have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell a bit on the UGC's decision before analyzing the implications. I relied on 
mainly two news reports

- [The freepress journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Jagadish lists four salient points, namely, 

- These foreign universities will have last word in curriculum, fee and recruitments. 
- No Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India without the approval ofthe UGC. 
- Universities having a position within the top 500 of overall/subject-wise global rankings, would be allowed to set up campuses in the country.
- NEP had said that top universities of the world would be allowed to operate in India and legislative framework would be in place.
- It is expected to stop brain drain. 

According to Prof Jagadish Kumar UGC has received responses from top univsersited and embassies and UGC is in final stages of incorporating
these responses. 

What are the implications of this announcement? Whatever little I can gather from the announcement is that 

- Foreign univsersities will belong to a different category of private universities.  
- They don't have to seek NAAC, AICTE or UGC approvals for courses.
- Their provost/VC/Presidents will operate independent as long as they stick to a given framework.
- May charge fees which they deem appropriate. 
- Central, state universities or private universities and will continue to operate as they are now.

There is no doubt that the country has a need for many good HEIs. However, allowing unfettered operation of foreign private universities could create 
many unforeseen problems. For example, is it possible for a consortium of foreigners acting as front of universities be allowed to build, own and 
operate HEI in India? Similarly, the laws of the land should be applied in dealing with disputes arising out of interactions between students,
employees on one hand and universities on the other hand. Obviously, a foreign university should not be a law unto themselves while operating inside
Indian territory. Indian courts should have jurisdiction in dealing with the disputes. I am assuming that UGC has taken good care of aforesaid issues
in dealing with the responses from foreign embassies and the universities interested in setting campuses here. 

Secondly, I wonder if world rank of 500 is enough. IMHO, ranking of HEIs do not depend on intrinsic strength of the universities. IITs or IISc
do not have good rankings. However, I have visited many US universities, where most professors believe IIT undergrads are best trained among the
foreign students. In was told by a professor that she is proud to have an IIT undergrad working in her lab. I met a few of my students in a 
research lab in Europe where many undergrads from IITK were working as interns. These interns were most sought after in the lab as research
assistants. Graduate studies at IITs is very different from undergraduate programs. The input to the graduate programs at IITs is 
exclusively from outside IIT system. It is a known fact that students outside IIT system have a different background and not very well prepared
for graduate studies in engineering. Therefore, graduate programs at IITs are obviously not at par with MIT, Yale, Harvard, Berkley or Stanford.
The focus of graduate studies at IISc is predominantly in science. Science education in many universities in the country are well established.
So, Ph. D program in science at IISc is quite competitive. I guess most foreign universities in India may start with graduate programs in Science.
If so, it may affect the Ph. D intakes at institutions like IISc and IISERs. Hopefully, UGC has weighed these problems in its scheme.  

Thirdly, fee structure at foreign universities will not be very different from what they charge in US or Europe. I guess the tuition fee for
undergraduate programs could be in the range of USD30-35k. May be they will reduce the fee a bit for campuses in India because their input
cost (faculty and support staff salaries, infrastructure, recurring expenses) will be substantially low. However, I don't see fee to be
under USD20k. On the other hand, it may affect IITs, IISc, IISERs are many potential faculty candidates will get hired by foreign universities.
So, I see it as a lose-lose situtation for India. Perhaps I am missing something here. Perhaps UGC may have factored these problem in their draft
proposal for allowing foreign universities to set shops in India. 

On the flip side, I see that UGC is not able to exercise much control over state universities. Most state universities are in shambles. Even
central universities have become dens of undesirable politician and loompen elements. It has affected overall scenario of higher education in India. 
So, the young undergraduate students are unable to fulfil cherished dream of a good training in India.
