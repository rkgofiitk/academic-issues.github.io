# Foreign Universities Setting up Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish Kumar disclosed in a press conference that "foreign universities like Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have 
been welcomed to set up camp in the country have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell a bit on the UGC's decision before
analyzing the implications. I relied on mainly two news reports

- [The freepress journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Kumar broadly lists following few points of the UGC's draft framework in this respect, 

- These foreign universities will have last word in curriculum, fee and recruitments. 
- Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India only after getting necessary approval from UGC. 
- Universities having overall/subject-wise global rankings within the top 500 would be allowed to set up campuses in the country.
- NEP had said that top universities of the world would be allowed to operate in India and legislative framework would be in place.
- It is expected to stop brain drain. 

According to Prof Kumar UGC has received responses from top univsersited and embassies and UGC is in final stages of incorporating these responses. 

What are the implications of this announcement? Whatever little I can gather from the announcement is that 

- Foreign univsersities will be a different category among private universities.  
- They don't have to seek NAAC, AICTE or UGC approvals for courses, or will sail throguh a different approval process.
- Their provost/VC/Presidents of thes universities will operate independent as long as they broadly stick to the so called UGC's framework.
- Thet may charge fees which they deem appropriate. 
- Other central, state universities or private universities and will have to operate as they are now.

There is no doubt that the country has a need for many good HEIs. However, allowing unfettered operations to foreign private universities could create 
many unforeseen problems. For example, is it possible for a consortium of foreigners acting as front of universities be allowed to build, own and 
operate an HEI in India? Would the laws of the land apply in dealing with disputes between students, employees and the foreign universities? 
Obviously, a foreign university should not be a law unto themselves while operating inside Indian territory. Indian courts should have jurisdiction 
in dealing with the disputes. I am assuming that UGC has taken good care of aforesaid issues in dealing with the responses from foreign embassies 
and the universities interested in setting campuses here. I think a special Act would be passed by the Parliament to enable it. I am not sure if
the framework may become applicable through executive orders.  

Now let us analyze academic decisions a bit. Is world ranking of 500 is enough? IMHO, ranking of HEIs do not depend on intrinsic strength of
the universities. Many IITs or IISc do not have good rankings. Some of the new IITs don't even qualify to apply for NIRF ranking. Does it mean
many state universities like JNTU, Anamalai or JU are better than these new IITs? If so, why many advance JEE ranking students choose such IITs
over the state universities? I have visited many US universities, where most professors I met believe IIT undergrads are the best trained among the
foreign students. In fact, one of the professors told me that she is proud to have an IIT undergrad working in her lab. In one my visits to
a famous research lab in Europe, I met a few of my student who worked as interns. These interns were most sought after in the lab as research
assistants. However, graduate studies at IITs is very different from undergraduate programs. The input to the graduate programs at IITs is 
exclusively from outside IIT system. It is a known fact that students outside IIT system have a different background and not very well prepared
for graduate studies in engineering. Therefore, an average graduate student at IITs is obviously not at par with an averahe graduate
student at any of top 200 universities of the world. 

The question is why good graduate students seek admissions into foreign universities? There are several reason for it. Let me list them out in 
order of importance.

- GATE exam is mandatory for seeking admission into graduate studies in IITs and IISc.
- The quality of life is much much better and comfortable in US than in India.
- The post-Ph. D. job opportunities are better in US than in India
- Research infrastructure even in an average US university is better than that at even at older IITs
  
Let me explain the reasons for my ordering. For GATE CSE, a student has to be proficient in at least four topics. Consider students from CMI,
ISI or IISERs. These students go through a Nation-wide test or must have qualified in KVPY or Olympiud in their respective disciplines. But 
they have no training in topics like OS, Computer Organization or Architecture and DBMS. It puts these students in a disadvantageous position. 
Only a few such student will sit for and qualify GATE. So, the requirement of GATE leaves out some of good students who may have strengthen 
the graduate programs at IITs or IISc. However, there cannot be any argument about points 2-4. Furthermore, these three point will still be 
true even if top 500 foreign universities set up their campuses in India. So, I am unable to appreciate UGC's view about stopping brain drain.
India still have to offer environment, space and opportunities for employement of people skilled in highend technology for stopping brain drain.
I remember years back Govt of India came up with a migration program for students to seek admission into M. Tech CS. The program was discontinued 
after many engineering colleges started offering B. Tech in CS. I believe a suitably updated migration program would have benefited graduate 
programs at IITs and IISc. 

I guess most foreign universities in India may start with graduate programs in Science.The focus of graduate studies at IISc is predominantly
in science. Science education in many universities and Labs in the country are well established. Ph. D program in sciences at IISc is quite 
competitive. I believe that graduate program in science education at foreign universities may affect the Ph. D intakes at institutions like 
IISc and IISERs. Hopefully, UGC has weighed these problems in its scheme.  

Another point of contention is the fee structure at foreign universities. I don't think it will not be very different from what they charge in US
or Europe. The tuition fee for undergraduate programs could be in the range of USD30-35k. Gaduate sudents get assistance from NSF grants or
work as teaching assistants. Foreign universities in India will compete for Govt sponsored projects and funding. It will have dual effects, namely,

- Shrinking of fund allocation for IISc, IITs, IISER and other CFTIs. 
- Talent migration from govt HEIs to foreign universities in India

I am not sure if the govt and UGC has a long-term plan for closure of all central institutions or relegate them to oblivion. If it comes true then
our education system will collapse. I have seen many private players in higher education system of India. Some good institutions are coming up
but they are a few. Most private players are driven by profits. They are concerned only about revenue receipt. Faculty is least priority. They
accept students as long as the pockets of the parents are deeper.  Except for a few institutions like BITS, Shivnader, Jindal, Jaypee, all private
institutions are like  teenagers creches.  

cost (faculty and support staff salaries, infrastructure, recurring expenses) will be substantially low. However, I don't see fee to be
under USD20k. On the other hand, it may affect IITs, IISc, IISERs are many potential faculty candidates will get hired by foreign universities.
So, I see it as a lose-lose situtation for India. Perhaps I am missing something here. Perhaps UGC may have factored these problem in their draft
proposal for allowing foreign universities to set shops in India. 

On the flip side, I see that UGC is not able to exercise much control over state universities. Most state universities are in shambles. Even
central universities have become dens of undesirable politician and loompen elements. It has affected overall scenario of higher education in India. 
So, the young undergraduate students are unable to fulfil cherished dream of a good training in India.
