# Foreign Universities Setting up Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish disclosed in a press conference that "[foreign universities like Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have been
welcomed to set up camp in the country]
have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell a bit on the UGC's decision before analyzing the implications. I relied on 
mainly two news reports

- [The freepress journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Jagadish lists four salient points, namely, 

- These foreign universities will have last word in curriculum, fee and recruitments. 
- No Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India without the approval ofthe UGC. 
- Only those having a position within the top 500 of overall/subject-wise global rankings, would be allowed to set up campuses in the country.
- It is expected to stop brain drain. 

What are the implication of this decision. How allowing foreign universities may affect higher education system in India. I believe Prof M. Jagadish has given up hope in shaping up Indian Universities and improving higher education through
regulatory mechanisms. So, UGC has chosen to 
make the system open and introduce fierce competetions among the players. That is a fairly well known strategy. Probably, students or parents will
choose best among the univsersities. It will automatically drive out the universities to closure if thay cannot survive the competition. However,
there is a catch.
