# UGC Announces Draft Framework for Foreign University Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish Kumar disclosed in a press conference that "foreign universities Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have 
been welcomed to set up camp in the country have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell on the UGC's decision before
analyzing the implications. I relied mainly on two news reports.

- [The free press journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Kumar broadly lists the following few points of the UGC's draft framework in this respect, 

- These foreign universities will have the last word in curriculum, fees, and recruitment. 
- Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India only after getting the necessary approval from UGC. 
- Universities having overall/subject-wise global rankings within the top 500 would be allowed in the country.
- NEP had said that top universities of the world would be allowed to operate in India, and a legislative framework would be in place.
- It is expected to stop the brain drain. 

According to Prof Kumar, UGC has received responses from top universities and embassies, and UGC is in the final stages of incorporating these responses. 
What are the implications of this announcement? Whatever little I can gather from the announcement is that: 

- Foreign universities will be a different category of private universities.  
- They don't have to seek NAAC, AICTE, or UGC course approvals; their internal process would be sufficient.
- The Provost/VC/Presidents of these universities will operate independently if they broadly stick to the UGC's draft framework.
- They may charge fees that they deem appropriate. 
- Other central, state, or private universities will have to operate as they are now.

There is no doubt that the country needs many good HEIs. However, allowing unfettered operations to foreign private universities could create 
many unforeseen problems. For example, can a consortium of foreigners acting as the front of universities be allowed to build, own and 
operate an HEI in India? Would the laws of the land apply in dealing with disputes between students, employees on one hand and foreign universities
on the other? A foreign university should not be a law unto itself while operating inside Indian territory. Indian courts should have jurisdiction 
in dealing with the disputes. I assume that UGC has taken good care of the issues above in dealing with the responses from foreign embassies 
and the universities interested in setting up campuses here. The Parliament would pass a particular Act to enable it. I wonder if
the framework will become applicable through executive orders.  

Let us analyze academic decisions. Is a world ranking of 500 enough? IMHO, the ranking of HEIs does not depend on the intrinsic strength of
the universities. Perception ranking is very important. Many IITs or IISc have better perception rankings. Some new IITs don't qualify to apply 
for the NIRF ranking. Does it mean many state universities like JNTU, Anamalai, JU, CU, and AU are better than these new IITs? Why do many advance 
JEE-ranking students choose such IITs over state universities. I have visited many US universities, where most professors I met believe IIT 
undergrads are the best trained among international students. One of the professors told me she is proud to have an IIT undergrad working in her
lab and would not expose him to others for fear of poaching! On one of my visits to a famous research lab in Europe, I met a few of my students who 
worked as interns. These interns were most sought after in the lab as research assistants. However, graduate studies at IITs are very different from 
undergraduate programs. The input to the graduate programs at IITs is exclusively from outside the IIT system. It is a known fact that students 
outside the IIT system have different backgrounds and need to prepare for graduate studies in engineering. Therefore, an average graduate student
at IITs is not at par with an average graduate student at any of the top 300 universities in the world. 

The question is, why do good graduate students seek admission into foreign universities? There are several reasons for it. Let me list them out in 
order of importance.

- The GATE exam is mandatory for seeking admission into graduate studies in IITs and IISc.
- The quality of life is much better and more comfortable in the US/Europe/Canada than in India.
- The post-Ph. D. job opportunities are better in the US/Europe/Canada than in India
- Research infrastructure, even in an average North American/European/Canadian university, is better than that at even at older IITs
  
Let me explain the reasons for my order. For example, a student has to be proficient in at least four topics to qualify for GATE CSE. Consider
students from CMI, ISI, or IISERs. These students pass a Nationwide test or must have qualified in KVPY or Olympiad in their respective disciplines. But 
they need a background in OS, Computer Organization or Architecture, and DBMS to qualify for GATE. It puts these students in a disadvantageous position. 
Only a few such students will sit for and qualify for GATE. The requirement of GATE leaves out some good students who may have strengthened 
the graduate programs at IITs or IISc. However, there cannot be any argument about points 2-4. Furthermore, these last three points will still be 
valid even if the top 500 foreign universities set up their campuses in India. So, I cannot appreciate UGC's view about stopping brain drain.
India still has to offer the environment, space, and opportunities to employ people skilled in high-end technology to stop the brain drain.
Years back, Govt of India came up with a migration program for students to seek admission into M. Tech CS. The program was discontinued 
after many engineering colleges started offering B. Tech in CS. A suitably updated migration program would have benefited graduate 
programs at IITs and IISc. 

Most foreign universities in India may start with graduate programs in Science. The focus of graduate studies at IISc is predominantly
on Science. Science education in many universities and Labs in the country is well established. Some of them like IISc, TIFR, Bose Institute,
Cultivation of Sciences, PRL, NPL, IoPB, NISER, and IISER have strong Ph. D programs in sciences. Graduate studies in Science at IISc are pretty 
competitive. Therefore, if foreign universities focus on graduate studies in Science, it may affect the Ph. D intakes at the above Indian
institutions. Hopefully, UGC has weighed these problems in its scheme.  

Another point of contention is the fee structure at foreign universities. It will be similar to what they charge in the US
, Europe, or Canada. The tuition fee for undergraduate programs is anywhere in the range of USD 30-35k. Graduate students get assistance from NSF 
grants or work as teaching assistants. Foreign universities in India will compete for Govt sponsored projects and funding. It will have dual 
effects, namely,

- Shrinking of fund allocation for IISc, IITs, IISER, and other CFTIs. 
- Talent migration from govt HEIs to foreign universities in India

I wonder if the government and UGC have a long-term plan to close all central institutions or relegate them to oblivion. If it comes true, then
our education system will collapse. I have seen many private players in the higher education system of India. Some good institutions are coming up, but 
they are only a few. Profits drive most private players. They are more concerned only about revenue receipt than anything else. Faculty is the least
priority for these institutions. They accept students as long as the pockets of the parents are deeper. Except for a few institutions like BITS, 
Shivnader, Jindal, Jaypee, Munjal, and Bennette, all private institutions, prefer to act like teenagers' creches.  

The cost (faculty and support staff salaries, infrastructure, recurring expenses) will be substantially low for foreign university campuses in
India. However, they may not charge a fee under USD 20k. On the other hand, it may affect IITs, IISc, and IISERs as many potentially
talented faculty candidates will get hired by foreign universities with better salaries. So, it is a lose-lose proposition for HEIs in India. 
The UGC may have factored this problem in their draft proposal for allowing foreign universities to set up shops in India. 

The UGC preferred to exercise little control over state universities. Most state universities are in shamble; these have become dens of undesirable 
politicians and lumpen elements. Even some of the central universities suffer from the same curse. It has affected the overall scenario of higher 
education in India. So, young undergraduate students need help to fulfill the dream of good training in India. The grapevine is that Govt want 
IITs to start BSc-BEd courses. I hope my understanding needs to be more accurate. However, if true, it is a conscious attempt to relegate IITs to
lose focus and provide only low-level support to higher education in India.
