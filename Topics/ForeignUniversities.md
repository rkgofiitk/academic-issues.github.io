# Foreign Universities Setting up Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish disclosed in a press conference that "[foreign universities like Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have been
welcomed to set up camp in the country]
have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell a bit on the UGC's decision before analyzing the implications. I relied on 
mainly two news reports

- [The freepress journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Jagadish lists four salient points, namely, 

- These foreign universities will have last word in curriculum, fee and recruitments. 
- No Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India without the approval ofthe UGC. 
- Universities having a position within the top 500 of overall/subject-wise global rankings, would be allowed to set up campuses in the country.
- NEP had said that top universities of the world would be allowed to operate in India and legislative framework would be in place.
- It is expected to stop brain drain. 

According to Prof Jagadish Kumar UGC has received responses from top univsersited and embassies and UGC is in final stages of incorporating
these responses. 

What are the implications of this announcement? Whatever little I can gather from the announcement is that 

- Foreign univsersities will belong to a different category of private universities.  
- They don't have to seek NAAC, AICTE or UGC approvals for courses.
- Their provost/VC/Presidents will operate independent as long as they stick to a given framework.
- May charge fees which they deem appropriate. 
- Central, state universities or private universities and will continue to operate as they are now.

There is no doubt that the country has a need for good HEIs. However, allowing unfettered operation of foreign private universities could create 
many unforeseen problems. For example, is it possible for a consortium of foreigners acting as front of universities be allowed to build, own and 
operate HEI in India? Similarly, the laws of the land should be applied in dealing with disputes arising out of interactions between students,
employees on one hand and universities on the other hand. Obviously, a foreign university should not be law unto themselves while operating inside
India. Indian courts should have jurisdiction in dealing with disputes. I am assuming that UGC has taken good care of aforesaid issues in 
dealing with the responses from foreign embassies. 

Secondly, is world rank of 500 enough? I guess not. Ranking is a different business than intrinsic strength of the universities. Yes, IITs or IISc
do not have good rankings. But I have visited many US universities, where professors believe IIT undergrads are best trained. I was told by a 
professor that she is proud to have an IIT undergrad working in her lab. I met a few of my students in a research lab in Europe where they were
working as interns. These interns were sought after in the lab for developing . Graduate studies is
very different. IITs are not able to compete as their input to graduate studies is outside IIT system. It is a known fact that students outside 
IIT system have very different background. 
  
How allowing foreign universities may affect higher education system in India. I believe Prof M. Jagadish has given up hope in shaping up Indian Universities and improving higher education through
regulatory mechanisms. So, UGC has chosen to 
make the system open and introduce fierce competetions among the players. That is a fairly well known strategy. Probably, students or parents will
choose best among the univsersities. It will automatically drive out the universities to closure if thay cannot survive the competition. However,
there is a catch.
