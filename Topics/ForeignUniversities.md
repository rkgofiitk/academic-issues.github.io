# Foreign Universities Setting up Campuses in India

UGC Chairperson Prof M. Jagadish Kumar disclosed in a press conference that "foreign universities like Yale, Harvard and Princeton and their likes have 
been welcomed to set up camp in the country have been allowed to set up shops (campuses) in India." Let me dwell on the UGC's decision before
analyzing the implications. I relied mainly on two news reports.

- [The free press journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/education/will-ugcs-guidelines-on-foreign-universities-in-india-fail-to-deliver), 
- [Hindu news report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ugc-to-announce-guidelines-for-setting-up-foreign-universities-in-may/article66680179.ece#)

According to these reports, Prof Kumar broadly lists the following few points of the UGC's draft framework in this respect, 

- These foreign universities will have the last word in curriculum, fees, and recruitment. 
- Foreign HEIs shall set up campuses in India only after getting the necessary approval from UGC. 
- Universities having overall/subject-wise global rankings within the top 500 would be allowed to set up campuses in the country.
- NEP had said that top universities of the world would be allowed to operate in India, and a legislative framework would be in place.
- It is expected to stop the brain drain. 

According to Prof Kumar, UGC has received responses from top universities and embassies, and UGC is in the final stages of incorporating these responses. 

What are the implications of this announcement? Whatever little I can gather from the announcement is that. 

- Foreign universities will be a different category from private universities.  
- They don't have to seek NAAC, AICTE, or UGC approvals for courses or will sail through a different approval process.
- The Provost/VC/Presidents of these universities will operate independently if they broadly stick to the so-called UGC's framework.
- They may charge fees that they deem appropriate. 
- Other central, state, or private universities will have to operate as they are now.

There is no doubt that the country needs many good HEIs. However, allowing unfettered operations to foreign private universities could create 
many unforeseen problems. For example, can a consortium of foreigners acting as the front of universities be allowed to build, own and 
operate an HEI in India? Would the laws of the land apply in dealing with disputes between students, employees, and foreign universities? 
A foreign university should not be a law unto itself while operating inside Indian territory. Indian courts should have jurisdiction 
in dealing with the disputes. I assume that UGC has taken good care of the issues above in dealing with the responses from foreign embassies 
and the universities interested in setting up campuses here. The Parliament would pass a particular Act to enable it. I don't know if
the framework will become applicable through executive orders.  

Let us analyze academic decisions. Is a world ranking of 500 enough? IMHO, the ranking of HEIs does not depend on the intrinsic strength of
the universities. Many IITs or IISc need better rankings. Some new IITs don't qualify to apply for the NIRF ranking. Does it mean
many state universities like JNTU, Anamalai, or JU are better than these new IITs? Why do many advance JEE-ranking students choose such IITs
over state universities if so? I have visited many US universities, where most professors I met believe IIT undergrads are the best trained among 
international students. One of the professors told me she is proud to have an IIT undergrad working in her lab. On one of my visits to
a famous research lab in Europe, I met a few of my students who worked as interns. These interns were most sought after in the lab as research
assistants. However, graduate studies at IITs are very different from undergraduate programs. The input to the graduate programs at IITs is 
exclusively from outside the IIT system. It is a known fact that students outside the IIT system have different backgrounds and need to prepare
for graduate studies in engineering. Therefore, an average graduate student at IITs is not at par with an average graduate
student at any of the top 200 universities in the world. 

The question is, why do good graduate students seek admission into foreign universities? There are several reasons for it. Let me list them out in 
order of importance.

- The GATE exam is mandatory for seeking admission into graduate studies in IITs and IISc.
- The quality of life is much better and more comfortable in the US than in India.
- The post-Ph. D. job opportunities are better in the US than in India
- Research infrastructure, even in an average US university, is better than that at even at older IITs
  
Let me explain the reasons for my order. For GATE CSE, a student has to be proficient in at least four topics. Consider students from CMI,
ISI or IISERs. These students pass a Nationwide test or must have qualified in KVPY or Olympiad in their respective disciplines. But 
they need OS, Computer Organization or Architecture, and DBMS training. It puts these students in a disadvantageous position. 
Only a few such students will sit for and qualify for GATE. The requirement of GATE leaves out some good students who may have strengthened 
the graduate programs at IITs or IISc. However, there cannot be any argument about points 2-4. Furthermore, this three-point will still be 
true even if the top 500 foreign universities set up their campuses in India. So, I cannot appreciate UGC's view about stopping brain drain.
India still has to offer the environment, space, and opportunities to employ people skilled in high-end technology to stop the brain drain.
Years back, Govt of India came up with a migration program for students to seek admission into M. Tech CS. The program was discontinued 
after many engineering colleges started offering B. Tech in CS. A suitably updated migration program would have benefited graduate 
programs at IITs and IISc. 

Most foreign universities in India may start with graduate programs in Science. The focus of graduate studies at IISc is predominantly
on Science. Science education in many universities and Labs in the country is well established. Ph. D program in sciences at IISc is quite 
competitive. I believe that graduate programs in science education at foreign universities may affect the Ph. D intakes at institutions like 
IISc and IISERs. Hopefully, UGC has weighed these problems in its scheme.  

Another point of contention is the fee structure at foreign universities. It will be similar to what they charge in the US
or Europe. The tuition fee for undergraduate programs could be in the range of USD 30-35k. Graduate students get assistance from NSF grants or
work as teaching assistants. Foreign universities in India will compete for Govt sponsored projects and funding. It will have dual effects, namely,

- Shrinking of fund allocation for IISc, IITs, IISER, and other CFTIs. 
- Talent migration from govt HEIs to foreign universities in India

I wonder if the government and UGC have a long-term plan to close all central institutions or relegate them to oblivion. If it comes true, then
our education system will collapse. I have seen many private players in the higher education system of India. Some good institutions are coming up, but they are a few. Profits drive most private players. They are concerned only about revenue receipt. Faculty is the least priority. They
accept students as long as the pockets of the parents are deeper. Except for a few institutions like BITS, Shivnader, Jindal, Jaypee, Munjal,
Bennette, all private institutions prefer to act like teenagers' creches.  

The cost (faculty and support staff salaries, infrastructure, recurring expenses) will be substantially low for foreign university campuses in
India. However, they may not charge a fee under USD 20k. On the other hand, it may affect IITs, IISc, and IISERs as many potentially
talented faculty candidates will get hired by foreign universities. So, it is a lose-lose proposition for HEIs in India. Perhaps I need to include 
something here. UGC may have factored this problem in their draft proposal for allowing foreign universities to set up shops in India. 

UGC preferred to exercise little control over state universities. Most state universities are in shambles. Even central universities have become
dens of undesirable politicians and lumpen elements. It has affected the overall scenario of higher education in India. So, young undergraduate
students need help to fulfill the dream of good training in India. The grapevine is that Govt want IITs to start BSc-BEd courses. It may
not be accurate. If so, there is probably a conscious attempt to relegate IITs to lose focus and provide only low-level support to
higher education in India.
