# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

I was watching TV discussions on the controvorsial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to light when NTA chief
Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. 

- Did NTA pre-announce award of grace marks?
- If so, did it also specify the situations under which grace marks be awarded?
- Whether the late start of test is one of those situation?
- How many test questions are wrong? 
- How much marks involved in wrong questions?
- What was the normalization scheme for award of grace marks?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted in any center?
- Did NTA prerserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- Why was the result published 10days in advance to coincide with election result day?
