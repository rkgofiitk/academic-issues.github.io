# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

I was watching TV discussions on the controvorsial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to 
light when NTA chief Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. Let me list
these out for the readers.

- Did NTA pre-announce the award of grace marks?
- If so, did it also specify the situations under which grace marks be awarded?
- Whether the late start of test is one of those situation?
- Is there a method for mapping lost time to problem solving ability of each candidate?
- Whether the mapping is unique or varies with difficulty level of the subject or the question or both?
- Did NTA use any AI assisted technique for doing so?
- If so, are these AI techniques provably correct, or what training data did it use?
- What is the maximum lost time across all centers?
- What is the maximum grace mark can a student be awarded for lost time
- How many test questions are wrong? 
- How much marks involved in wrong questions?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted in any center?
- Did NTA prerserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- If so, would the investation committee have acces to those images?
- How could the ranks explode beyond 58000 for marks in range 650-600?
- Why was the result published 10days in advance to coincide with election result day?
- Is there an instance when NTA published results 10 days in advance?

Mr. Alakh Pandey of Physicswalla says NTA's clarifications did not deal with the question that Bihar 
police arrested some people from Gujrat and Patna. Some of these arrested persons reportedly paid up to 
50 lacs to get test paper ahead of test date. Mr. Pandey also tells that there are people in different 
states who are in business of systematic leaking question papers with a price. He particularly 
mentioned about places like Bangalore and UP. How could NTA be unware of what Alakh Pandey says. The
second major point is about the award of grace marks. NTA claimed that it was awarded to compensate
lost time in examination. However, the supreme court verdict NTA cited was in respect of CLAT 
examination. There are three basic issues here:

- CLAT is an online examination whereas NEET is an offline examination.
- What is formula for estimating the answering efficiency of an average candidate in an offline test?
- Did NTA preserve CCTV images for evaluating centers where loss of time occurred? 

NTA reported to have clarified that loss of time occurred at least six centers in Sawai Madhavpur
district of Rajasthan. However, NTA did not clarify if all 1563 students who were awarded grace
marks belonged to only to these six centers. I cannot comprehend how the answering efficiency of a 
student can be estimated without applying LLM model, especially when three different subjects (PCB) are 
involved. If indeed NTA applied LLM model, kudos to it! We should hail the innovation. 

Let me turn to menace of coaching centers. At IITs, we knew many retired science professors attached 
to coaching centers would drop by in the pretext of catching with old colleagues close to JEE 
preparation time. The sole aim of bonhomie was to extract the pattern of JEE (advance) test. 
JEE organizing chairperson would routinely go incommunicado for the entire year to ward off 
the sophisticated bots. Of course, I am talking about the times whe AI-based techniques for
hacking were not quite common place. I am not sure if some of the sophisticated coaching centers
have used ChatGPT 4o or Gemini 1.5 or even more advanced Open AI based techniques.

NTA on its own accord scrapped grace marks and assure the supreme court that the ranks of 1563 
students will be recalculated. They may have a retest chance scheduled on June 23, 2024. I am
not sure if only 1563 or more students were given grace marks. How can an agency which goofed
up so badly be believed. However, it is difficult to extract more information unless an 
investigating agency really goes hard on the trails. 

Considering that fact NTA conducts entrance tests such as JEE(mains), NEET, CMAT, GPAT, JNUEE and UGC 
NET, it must have a standing committee for ethics and security. However, no one talks about the 
existence of such a committee in public domain. So, it is not clear if NTA does have a set up to
handle ethics and security. The combined number of aspirants who sit for these tests would 
probably exceed 5.0 million at present. Assuming about 10% anual increase in the number of aspirants
across tests, I believe the number would be 7.5 million after five years when the current 
government demits the office. I am not sure if the agency has plans in place to handle the 
situation when it is already flaundering miserably with its current bandwidth. The NEET fiasco 
appears to indicate that the insiders in the agency are actively involved with the pan-national
criminals for compromising NEET. 

The angle of criminality in leakage of test papers appears real at first instance. Let us get a
rough estimate of the expected improvement in performance of the test aspirants. 
There is rise of 0.3 million in the number of aspirants compared to 2023. At the top end the
quality of students remains almost identical or a marginal improvement in ranks. Even if I assume
100% performance improvement in top 1000 aspirants, I guess top <i>n</i> students may now become
top <i>2n</i> students bunching in first 1000 places. It is true that bunching becomes 
progressively more down the list. However, it is suprising to see that it has exceeded almost
5 times compared to 2023 when the overall increase in the number of candidates is just 25%. We
must understand here that the entrance tests are used as filters (elimination) rather than
selection. So, it makes little sense to treat it as qualifiers, especially, when the country
cannot offer equal opportunities to all in the field of medical education. The governments before
2014 did not anticipate the problem and allowed MCI to establish its stranglehold over medical 
education system in the country. 

The committee of academics and UPSC chairpersons are not trained to investigate criminal angle of
the test fiasco. Does it mean that NTA is absolutely confident that no leakage happened ever? 
However, watching the press conference, I felt NTA chief was evasive, and not direcly answering 
pointed questions. He only harped on 
transparency of NTA processes. The secretary education dept of Govt of India, Mr. Sanjeev Murthy who
was present during the press conference did not given any clarification or take any question from the 
press. Is the government looking for a fall guy? If so, Mr. Singh will in all probability be the
fall guy. However, no one is prepared to take the responsibility of putting the future of 1.3 million 
qualifiers in jeopardy. I also did not understand the logic of declaring 1.3  qualifiers when only
0.1 million seats are available. It appears those who scored 640-650 won't find a place in any of 
the government medical colleges because total number of seat in these colleges is about 42k.
