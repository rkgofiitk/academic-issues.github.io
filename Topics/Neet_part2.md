# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

[Blog Index](../index.md)

I was watching TV discussions on the controversial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to 
light when NTA chief Mr. Subodh K. Singh clarified the discrepancies in the results of NEET 2024. Let 
me list these out for the readers.

- Did NTA pre-announce the award of grace marks?
- If so, did it specify the situations under which grace marks should be awarded?
- Are the late start and loss of time due to the wrong question included? 
- Is there a known scientific method of mapping lost time to the problem-solving efficiency of a candidate?
- Is the mapping unique or varies with the difficulty level of the subject or the question?
- Did NTA use any AI-assisted technique to determine problem-solving efficiency?
- If so, are these AI techniques correct, and what training data did they use?
- What is the maximum lost time across all centers?
- What is the maximum grace mark a student can be awarded for the lost time?
- How many test questions were wrong? 
- How many marks are involved in wrong questions?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted at any center?
- Did NTA preserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- If so, did the expert committee have access to those images?
- How could the ranks explode to 58k for marks in the range of 650-600?
- Why was the result published ten days earlier to coincide with election result day?
- Is there an instance in the past where NTA published results ten days in advance?
- Why was the registration window reopened between April 9-10? 

Mr. Alakh Pandey of Physicswalla says NTA's clarifications did not address Bihar and Gujrat 
police arresting some people from Gujrat and Patna. Some of these arrested persons reportedly paid
up to INR 5 million to get test paper ahead of test date. Mr. Pandey also says that people in 
different states are in the business of systematically leaking question papers with a price. He 
particularly mentioned places like Bangalore and UP. How could NTA be unaware of what Alakh Pandey 
says? The second major point is about the award of grace marks. NTA claimed that it was awarded to 
compensate for lost time in examination. The Supreme Court verdict NTA cited in this respect refers to
the CLAT 2018 examination. We need to keep the following points about the CLAT decision on grace marks:

- CLAT is an online examination, whereas NEET is an offline examination.
- CLAT was instructed to seek representations from all candidates through a portal and resolve them.
  
Since CLAT had a recording of the candidate's clock, it could determine the exact loss of time for each
candidate. It could also estimate the problem-solving efficiency from time spent on solving questions.
Though the method is not entirely scientific, it allowed a level playing field for the 
award of grace marks. NEET is an offline examination. So, it is surprising how the so-called expert
committee arrived at the formula for measuring the problem-solving efficiency of the candidates. In
particular,

- What formula did the expert committee recommend for estimating the answering efficiency of an average candidate in an offline test?
- Did the NTA preserve CCTV footage and allow its access to the expert committee? 

NTA reportedly clarified that time loss occurred at only one center in the Sawai Madhavpur
district of Rajasthan. However, NTA later admitted in the Supreme Court that 1563 students from six 
centers had been awarded grace marks. Many got wind of grace marks when it was revealed that
many examinees got 718 and 719 marks. Every question was worth 4 points, and the penalty for a wrong 
answer was -1.  A candidate can score 715 or 716 but not 717-719. Furthermore, there is a
center at Bahadurgarh in Haryana where six students scored 720. How is that possible? A statistically 
outlier event.-

I cannot comprehend how the answering efficiency of a student can be estimated without applying the 
LLM model, especially when three different subjects (PCB) are involved. If NTA indeed applied the LLM 
model, kudos to it! They may have also used AI to examine CCTV footage to ascertain time loss.  We 
should hail the innovation. The next step NTA is probably planning is to experiment  
with using humanoid robots for invigilation and examination management!

Let me digress a bit and turn to the menace of coaching centers. At IITs, we knew many retired science 
professors attached to coaching centers would drop by on the pretext of catching up with old 
colleagues close to JEE preparation time. The sole aim of <i>bonhomie</i> was to extract the pattern 
of the JEE (advance) test. The JEE organizing chairperson would routinely go incommunicado for the 
entire year to ward off these sophisticated bots. Of course, I am talking about the times when AI-
based techniques for hacking were inadequate. Have some sophisticated coaching centers
used ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5, or even more advanced Open AI-based techniques?

NTA, on its own accord, scrapped grace marks and assured the Supreme Court that the ranks of 1563 
students will be recalculated. They may have a retest chance scheduled on June 23, 2024. I wonder if 
only 1563 or more students were given grace marks. How can an agency that goofed
up so badly be believed about the figures they put out in the public domain? However, it is difficult
to extract more information unless an investigating agency goes hard on the trails. 

Considering that fact, NTA conducts entrance tests such as JEE (mains), NEET, CMAT, GPAT, JNUEE, and 
UGC; it must have a standing committee for ethics and security. It is unclear if NTA does have a 
setup to handle ethics and security. The combined number of aspirants who sit for these tests would 
exceed 5.0 million at present. Assuming a 10% annual increase in the number of aspirants
across tests, the number would be 7.5 million after five years when the current 
government demits the office. I wonder if the agency has plans to handle the 
situation when it is already floundering miserably with its current bandwidth. 

The NEET fiasco appears to indicate that the insiders in the agency are actively involved with the 
pan-national criminals for compromising NEET and other entrance tests. 
The angle of criminality in the leakage of test papers appears natural. Let us get a
rough estimate of the expected improvement in the performance of the test aspirants. 
There is rise of 0.3 million in the number of aspirants compared to 2023. At the top end, the
quality of students remains almost identical, or there is a marginal improvement in rank. 
Performance improvement in the top 1000 aspirants would be at least 10-15% at best. So,
at most <i>1.15n</i>, students may bunch for the top 1000 places. It is true that bunching 
progressively increases down the ranking list. Surprisingly, the figure has exceeded almost
five times compared to 2023, though the overall increase in the number of candidates is just 25%. We
must understand that the entrance tests are used as filters (elimination) rather than
selection. So, it makes little sense to treat it as a qualifier, especially when the country
cannot offer equal medical education opportunities. The governments before
2014 did not anticipate the problem and allowed MCI to establish its stranglehold over the medical 
education system in the country.

The academic committee chaired by the UPSC chairperson that NTA has appointed cannot investigate
the criminal angle of the test fiasco. How can NTA be sure that leakage never happened? 
While watching the press conference, I noticed that the NTA chief was evasive and did not directly 
answer pointed questions. He only harped on the transparency of NTA processes. The secretary of 
education, Government of India, Mr. Sanjeev Murthy, who was present during the press conference, 
did not give any clarification or take any questions from the press. That, too, was odd. Why did he 
have to show up physically if he was not participating? Is the government looking for a fall guy? If
so, Mr. Singh will, in all probability, be the fall guy. However, no one is prepared to take the 
responsibility of jeopardizing the future of 1.3 million qualifiers. 

Mr. Alakh Pandey's concern regarding reopening the registration window from 9-10 April 2024 indicates 
a systematic design for hacking the test. Did NTA reopen it only to facilitate the change of centers?
It is reported that sixteen students wanted to opt for one specific center in Godra, Gujrat. Did all of
them score good marks? What are the ranks of these students?

Lastly, I also did not understand the logic of declaring 1.3 million qualifiers when only
0.1 million seats are available. Those who scored 640-650 won't find a place in government medical
colleges because the total number of seats in these colleges is about 42k.
