# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

I was watching TV discussions on the controvorsial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to light when NTA chief
Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. 

- NTA booklet did not have provision for awarding grace marks
- Rexamination was conducted in a center even though they announced no retest
- The result announced 10days in advance to coincide with election result day
