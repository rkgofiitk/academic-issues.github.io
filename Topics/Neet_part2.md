# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

[Blog Index](../index.md)

I was watching TV discussions on the controversial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to 
light when NTA chief Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. Let me list
these out for the readers.

- Did NTA pre-announce the award of grace marks?
- If so, did it specify the situations under which grace marks should be awarded?
- Are the late start and loss of time due to the wrong question included? 
- Is there a known scientific method of mapping lost time to the problem-solving efficiency of a candidate?
- Is the mapping unique or varies with the difficulty level of the subject or the question?
- Did NTA use any AI-assisted technique to determine problem-solving efficiency?
- If so, are these AI techniques provably correct, and what training data did it use?
- What is the maximum lost time across all centers?
- What is the maximum grace mark a student can be awarded for lost time?
- How many test questions are wrong? 
- How many marks are involved in wrong questions?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted at any center?
- Did NTA preserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- If so, did the expert committee have access to those images?
- How could the ranks explode to 58k for marks in the range of 650-600?
- Why was the result published ten days earlier to coincide with election result day?
- Is there an instance in the past where NTA published results ten days in advance?
- Why was the registration window reopened between April 9-10? 

Mr. Alakh Pandey of Physicswalla says NTA's clarifications did not deal with the question that Bihar 
police arrested some people from Gujrat and Patna. Some of these arrested persons reportedly paid up to 
INR 5 million to get test paper ahead of test date. Mr. Pandey also says that people in different 
states are in the business of systematically leaking question papers with a price. He particularly 
mentioned places like Bangalore and UP. How could NTA be unaware of what Alakh Pandey says? The
second major point is about the award of grace marks. NTA claimed that it was awarded to compensate
for lost time in examination. The supreme court verdict NTA cited in this respect refers to the CLAT 2018
examination. We need to keep the following points about the CLAT decision on grace marks:

- CLAT is an online examination, whereas NEET is an offline examination.
- CLAT was instructed to seek representations from all candidates through a portal and resolve them.
  
Since CLAT had a recording of the candidate's clock, it could determine the exact loss of time for each
candidate. It could also estimate the problem-solving efficiency from time spent on solving questions.
Though the method is not entirely scientific, it allowed a level playing field for the 
award of grace marks. NEET is an offline examination. So, it is surprising how the so-called expert
committee arrived at the formula for measuring the problem-solving efficiency of the candidates. More
precisely,

- What is the formula for estimating the answering efficiency of an average candidate in an offline test?
- Did NTA preserve CCTV images to evaluate centers where the loss of time occurred? 

NTA reported clarifying that time loss occurred in at least six centers in the Sawai Madhavpur
district of Rajasthan. However, NTA needed to explain if all 1563 students awarded grace
marks belonged to only these six centers. I cannot comprehend how the answering efficiency of a 
student can be estimated without applying the LLM model, especially when three different subjects (PCB) are 
involved. If NTA indeed applied the LLM model, kudos to it! We should hail the innovation. 
Furthermore, there is a center at Bahadurgarh in Haryana where six students scored 720. How was that 
possible? 



Let me turn to the menace of coaching centers. At IITs, we knew many retired science professors attached 
to coaching centers would drop by on the pretext of catching up with old colleagues close to JEE 
preparation time. The sole aim of Bonhomie was to extract the pattern of the JEE (advance) test. 
JEE organizing chairperson would routinely go incommunicado for the entire year to ward off 
these sophisticated bots. Of course, I am talking about the times when AI-based techniques for
hacking were rare place. I wonder if some of the sophisticated coaching centers
have used ChatGPT 4o or Gemini 1.5 or even more advanced Open AI-based techniques.

NTA, on its own accord, scrapped grace marks and assured the Supreme Court that the ranks of 1563 
students will be recalculated. They may have a retest chance scheduled on June 23, 2024. I don't 
know if only 1563 or more students were given grace marks. How can an agency that goofed
up so badly be believed about the figures they put out in the public domain? However, it is difficult
to extract more information unless an investigating agency goes hard on the trails. 

Considering that fact NTA conducts entrance tests such as JEE(mains), NEET, CMAT, GPAT, JNUEE, and UGC 
NET must have a standing committee for ethics and security. However, I did not find anything about the 
existence of such a committee, at least in the public domain. So, it is unclear if NTA does have a setup to
handle ethics and security. The combined number of aspirants who sit for these tests would 
exceed 5.0 million at present. Assuming a 10% annual increase in the number of aspirants
across tests, the number would be 7.5 million after five years when the current 
government demits the office. I don't know if the agency has plans to handle the 
situation when it is already floundering miserably with its current bandwidth. The NEET fiasco 
appears to indicate that the insiders in the agency are actively involved with the pan-national
criminals for compromising NEET and other entrance tests. 

The angle of criminality in the leakage of test papers appears natural. Let us get a
rough estimate of the expected improvement in the performance of the test aspirants. 
There is rise of 0.3 million in the number of aspirants compared to 2023. At the top end, the
quality of students remains almost identical, or there is a marginal improvement in rank. 
Performance improvement in the top 1000 aspirants would be at least 10-15% at best. So,
at most <i>1.15n</i>, students may bunch for the top 1000 places. It is true that bunching 
progressively increases down the list. However, it is surprising to see that it has exceeded almost
Five times compared to 2023, when the overall increase in the number of candidates is just 25%. We
must understand that the entrance tests are used as filters (elimination) rather than
selection. So, it makes little sense to treat it as a qualifier, especially when the country
cannot offer equal medical education opportunities. The governments before
2014 did not anticipate the problem and allowed MCI to establish its stranglehold over the medical 
education system in the country.

The committee of academics and UPSC chairpersons appointed by NTA are not trained to investigate
the criminal angle of the test fiasco. How can NTA be sure that no leakage ever happens? 
However, watching the press conference, I felt the NTA chief needed to be more evasive and not directly answer 
pointed questions. He only harped on the transparency of NTA processes. The secretary of education dept of 
Govt of India, Mr. Sanjeev Murthy, who was present during the press conference, did not give any 
clarification or take any questions from the press. That, too, was odd. Why did he have to show up
physically if he was not participating? Is the government looking for a fall guy? If so, Mr. Singh 
will, in all probability, be the fall guy. However, no one is prepared to take the responsibility of 
putting the future of 1.3 million qualifiers in jeopardy. 

Mr. Alakh Pandey's concern regarding reopening the registration window from 9-10 April 2024 indicates 
a sinister design. Did NTA reopen it to facilitate the change of centers? It is reported that sixteen
students were clubbed into one center in Godra, Gujrat. Did all of them changed their centers during the two day time.

Lastly, I also did not understand the logic of declaring 1.3  qualifiers when only
0.1 million seats are available. Those who scored 640-650 won't find a place in government medical colleges
because the total number of seats in these colleges is about 42k.
