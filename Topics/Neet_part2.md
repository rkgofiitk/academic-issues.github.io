# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

I was watching TV discussions on the controvorsial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to light when NTA chief
Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. 

- Did NTA pre-announce the award of grace marks?
- If so, did it also specify the situation under which grace marks be awarded?
- Whether the late start of test is one of those situation?
- Is there a method for mapping lost time to problem solving ability of each candidate?
- Whether the mapping is unique or varies with difficulty level of the subject or the question or both?
- Did NTA use any AI assisted technique for doing so?
- If so, are these AI techniques provably correct, or what training data did it use?
- What is the maximum lost time across all centers?
- What is the maximum grace mark can a student be awarded for lost time
- How many test questions are wrong? 
- How much marks involved in wrong questions?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted in any center?
- Did NTA prerserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- If so, would the investation committee have acces to those images?
- How could the ranks explode beyond 58000 for marks in range 650-600?
- Why was the result published 10days in advance to coincide with election result day?
- Is there an instance when NTA published results 10 days in advance?

Mr. Alakh Pandey of Physicswalla says NTA's clarification did not deal with the question that Bihar 
police arrested some people from Gujrat and Patna. Some of these arrested persons reportedly paid up to 
50 lacs to get test paper ahead of test date. Mr. Pandey also tells that there are people in different 
states who are in business of systematic leaking question papers with a price. How could NTA be 
unware of what Alakh Pandey says. I believe that NTA has a security aparatus considering the fact
they conduct tests for nearly 5.0 million students for many admissions tests such as JEE(mains), NEET,
CMAT, GPAT, JNUEE and UGC NET. 
It clearly points 
to the fact that NTA's house is not in order. There are insiders in the agency who are actively involved with the pan-national
criminals. Quite obviously, there is an angle of criminality in leakage of test papers. The committee of academics and UPSC
chairpersons are not trained to investigate criminal angle of the test fiasco. Does it mean that NTA is absolutely confident 
that no leakage happened ever? Watching the press conference, I felt NTA chief was evasive, and not direcly answering pointed
questions. He only harped on transparency of NTA processes. The secretary education dept of Govt of India, Mr. Sandip Murthy who
was present during the press conference did not given any clarification or take any question from the press. Is the government
looking for a fall guy? If so, Mr. Singh will be fall guy. However, no one is prepared to take the responsibility of putting
the future of 13 lac qualifiers in jeopardy. I also did not understand the logic of declaring 13 lac qualifiers when only
1 lac seats are available. It appears those who scored 640-650 won't find a place in any of the government medical colleges
because total number of seat in these colleges is about 42k.
