# NTA's NEET (Neat) Scam

I was watching TV discussions on the controvorsial NEET 2024 results. Many unexplained issues came to light when NTA chief
Mr. Subodh K. Singh was giving clarifications on NEET 2024 results. 

- Did NTA pre-announce the award of grace marks?
- If so, did it also specify the situation under which grace marks be awarded?
- Whether the late start of test is one of those situation?
- Is there a method for mapping lost time to problem solving ability of each candidate?
- Whether the mapping is unique or varies with difficulty level of the subject or the question or both?
- Did NTA use any AI assisted technique for doing so?
- If so, are these AI techniques provably correct, or what training data did it use?
- What is the maximum lost time across all centers?
- What is the maximum grace mark can a student be awarded for lost time
- How many test questions are wrong? 
- How much marks involved in wrong questions?
- Who constituted the expert committee recommending the award of grace marks?
- Did NTA follow the exact recommendation of the expert committee?
- Was a retest conducted in any center?
- Did NTA prerserve the full recording of CCTV images at the centers?
- If so, would the investation committee have acces to those images?
- Why was the result published 10days in advance to coincide with election result day?
- Is there an instance when NTA published results 10 days in advance?

Mr. Alakh Pandey of Physicswalla says NTA's clarification did not deal with the question that Bihar police arrested some people 
from Gujrat. Some of these arrested persons reportedly paid up to 50 lacs to get test paper ahead of test date. It was not clear
how an investigation by a committee of four headed by Chairperson UPSC could resolve these issue. Quite obviously, there is an
angle of criminality in leakage of test papers. The committee of academics and UPSC chairpersons are not trained to investigate
criminal angle of the test fiasco. Does it mean that NTA is absolutely sure that no leakage happened ever? Watching the press
conference, I felt NTA chief was evasive not direcly answering pointed questions. He only harped on transparency of NTA processes.
The secretary education dept of Govt of India, Mr. Sandip Murthy did not take any question from the press or say a word during
the entire press conference.
