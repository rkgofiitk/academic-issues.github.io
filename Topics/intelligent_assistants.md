# AI Assistants in Research Innovation, a Reality

Many employ voice-based virtual assistant like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa and Google 
Assistant for various tasks such as setting alarms, reminders, and several context-aware conversational
commands like switching on gysers, shutting down air conditioner, preparing shopping lists, giving navigation
instruction to a self-driven vehicle, and so on.

Much of the stock market predictions are increasingly AI-based. There are many investment instruments like quant
fund that rely on machine learning prediction models for portfolio management. The quant fund managers boast
that investments in quant funds could generate returns in the range of 77-83% according to back testing
results. I am  unaware of checks and balances that SEBI has put in place to assure the investors that 
these AI-oriented, data-driven prediction models are not entirely misleading. 

Robotic surgery and applications of industrial robots have become quite well-established in precision
surgery and industrial manufacturing processes. Construction activities have become largely automated and 
Industry 4.0 is a reality even in heavy industries like steel macking. Bhilai steel plant's rail making process
is completely automated. We have reached the age of driverless cabs, trains and transportation
services. Most these activities are heavily sesnor-based and AI-driven.  

One can guess that the intelligent assistants may progressively graduate to become scientific research 
assistants with extension of AI-comfort in lessening human pains, suffering, travails and toils, Experimental
set ups are mostly handled by precision instruments and automation. Much of research in drug discovery, clinical
informatics span across geographically dispersed labs. Agreegation and fusing of results from early
discovery through development to manufacturing is now being increasingly controlled by virtual assistants.
There are platforms like Amazon Lambda that host a custom skill for interacting  with the laboratory 
device shadows and reacts with speech processed commands. Computational chemists have developed
end-to-end AI research assistant like Coscientist that takes over tedious time-consuming tasks like
deciding reaction conditions and writing code for automated systems. [Gabe Gomes’s team at CMU use the GPT-4 to perform 
different functions inside Coscientist. Coscientist demonstrated capabilities to autonomously design, plan and 
perform palladium-catalysed carbon–carbon bond formation reactions, originally described in a preprint in April 2023.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0)

The other major aspects of research include literature survey, report writing and publication. Literature survey is 
now assisteed mostly by intelligent generative AI-based search assistants like Gemini. Many have started relying

It will be interesting to surmise that in next few years much of research in humanities, social sciences and
management would be AI-driven. AI's role in mathematicel science appears counter-intuitive as mathematics 
is dependent on rigorous definitions, derivations and proofs  [So, as of now AI systems are ill-equipped
to be assistance to create human validated research in mathematical sciences](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00740-1)
However, the combination of human expertise and AI algorithms will become an integral part of theoretical research 
in near future as it is already in the case of social sciences. In fact, carefully-curated AI augmented mathematical 
education systems may do a much better job than an average human tutor. The US department of education has created a 
[policy document](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf) on the automation based association
to education and learning. The report refers to AI's role in education as a double-edged sword that can be "virtuous" or "vicious".

The year 2024's nobel prize in Physics has been awarded to Molecular Biologist John Hopfield and Computer Scientist.
Giffry Hinton for their "Foundational discoveries and innovations that enable machine learning with artifical
neural network." The heart of their research is AI-assisted. Likewise, Nobel prize and chemistry went
to David Baker, a Professor in Biochemistry and John Jumper, Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google Deepmind.
The citations refer to their research in "computational protein structure design" and  "protein structure prediction", 
respectively. Physicists and Chemists were predictably very upset. Yannis Ioannidis in an oped in CACM
terms AI-drive scientific discovery as the 5th Paradigm. Reverse engineering research could be a 
real game-changer in establishing theories and conjectures. Ioannidis surmises: "Can we expect AI to transform
from a tool to an actual researcher itself, pose and investigate scientific hypotheses, and eventually write
papers about its work?" In otherwords, can AI become a peer for human in research and innovation? Can 
human peer-reviewers be able to even ask probing questions to evaluate AI-driven research?
