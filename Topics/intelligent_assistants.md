# AI Assistants in Research Innovation, a Reality

[Blog Index](../index.md)

Many employ voice-based virtual assistants like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google 
Assistant for various tasks such as setting alarms, reminders, and several context-aware conversational
commands like switching on geysers, shutting down the air conditioner, preparing shopping lists, giving navigation
instruction to a self-driven vehicle, and so on.

Much of the stock market predictions are increasingly AI-based. Many investment instruments like quant
funds rely on machine learning prediction models for portfolio management. Citing backtesting results, the quant fund managers boast
that investments in quant funds could generate returns of 77-83%. I am unaware of the checks and balances that SEBI has put in place to assure the investors that 
these AI-oriented, data-driven prediction models are not entirely misleading. 

Robotic surgery and industrial robot applications have become reasonably well-established in precision
surgery and industrial manufacturing processes. Construction activities have become largely automated and 
Industry 4.0 is a reality even in heavy industries like steelmaking. The rail-making process at the Bhilai steel plant
is completely automated. We have reached the age of driverless cabs, trains, and transportation
services. Most of these activities are heavily sensor-based and AI-driven.  

The intelligent assistants may progressively graduate to become scientific research 
assistants with the extension of AI-comfort in lessening human pains, suffering, travails, and toils. Precision 
instruments and automation primarily handle experimental setups in hazardous substances. Much research in drug discovery and clinical
informatics spans geographically dispersed labs. Virtual assistants increasingly control aggregation and fuse results from early
discovery through development to manufacturing.
Platforms like Amazon Lambda host a custom skill for interacting with the laboratory 
device shadows and reacting with speech-processed commands. Computational chemists have developed
end-to-end AI research assistants like "Coscientist" that takes over tedious, time-consuming tasks like
deciding reaction conditions and writing code for automated systems. [Gabe Gomes's team at CMU uses the GPT-4 to perform 
different functions inside Coscientist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0).
Coscientist demonstrated capabilities to autonomously design, plan, and 
perform palladium-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formation reactions, originally described in a preprint in April 2023.

The other significant aspects of research include a literature survey, report writing, and publication. Literature surveys are 
now assisted primarily by intelligent generative AI-based search assistants like Gemini. Many have started relying  
on [p-hacking ](https://rkgofiitk.github.io/academic-issues.github.io/Topics/Prompt_engineering.html) in quest for establishing research hypothesis.
It will be interesting to surmise that much of humanities, social sciences, and
management research will be AI-driven in the next few years. AI's role in mathematical science appears counter-intuitive as mathematics 
is dependent on rigorous definitions, derivations, and proofs  [So, as of now, AI systems are ill-equipped
to be assistance in creating human-validated research in mathematical sciences.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00740-1)
However, the combination of human expertise and AI algorithms will become an integral part of theoretical research 
in the near future, as is already the case in social sciences. Carefully curated AI-augmented mathematical 
education systems may do a much better job than an average human tutor. The US Education Department has created a 
[policy document](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf) on the automation-based association
to education and learning. The report refers to AI's role in education as a double-edged sword that can be "virtuous" or "vicious."

In 2024,  Molecular Biologist John Hopfield and Computer Scientist.
Geoffrey Hinton received the Nobel Prize for their "Foundational discoveries and Innovations that enable machine learning with artificial
neural network." The heart of their research is AI-assisted. Likewise, Nobel prizes in chemistry went
to David Baker, a professor of biochemistry, and John Jumper, Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google Deepmind.
The citations refer to their research in "computational protein structure design" and "protein structure prediction," 
respectively. Physicists and Chemists were predictably very upset. In an oped in CACM, Yannis Ioannidis terms 
AI-driven scientific discovery as the 5th Paradigm. Reverse engineering research could be a 
real game-changer in establishing theories and conjectures. Ioannidis surmises: "Can we expect AI to transform
from a tool to an actual researcher itself, pose and investigate scientific hypotheses, and eventually write
papers about its work?" In other words, can AI become a peer for humans in research and innovation? Can 
human peer reviewers even ask probing questions to evaluate AI-driven research?
