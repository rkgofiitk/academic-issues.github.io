# Impact of AI Assistants in Research Innovation

Many employ voice-based virtual assistant like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa and Google 
Assistant for various tasks such as setting alarms, reminders, and several context-aware conversational
commands like switching on gysers, shutting down air conditioner, preparing shopping lists and so on.

Much of stock market predictions are now AI-based. There are many investment instruments like quant
fund which rely on machine learning models for portfolio managment. SBI has announced that its quant
fund NFO could generate returns on investment in the range of 77-83% according to their back testing
result. I am not quite sure what checks and balances SEBI has to assure the investors that these 
AI-oriented, data-driven prediction models are not entirely misleading. 

Robotic surgery and application of industrial robots has become quite well-established in precision
surgery and manufacturing. Construction activities have become mostly automated and Industry 4.0
is a reality. We have almost reached the age of driverless cabs, trains and transportation
system. Most these activities are heavily AI-driven.  

However, extending the possibility of reach AI-comfort in lessening human pains, suffering,
travails and toils, one can guess that the intelligent assistants may one day
graduate to become scientific research assistants. We are already witnessing

It will be interesting to surmise that in next few years much theoretical research would be AI-driven.

The year 2024's nobel prize in Physics has been awarded to Molecular Biologist John Hopfield and Computer Scientist.
Giffry Hinton for their "Foundational discoveries and innovations that enable machine learning with artifical
neural network." The heart of their research is AI-assisted. Likewise, Nobel prize and chemistry went
to David Baker, a Professor in Biochemistry and John Jumper, Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google Deepmind.
The citations refer to their research in "computational protein structure design" and  "protein structure prediction", 
respectively. Physicists and Chemists were predictably very upset. Yannis Ioannidis in an oped in CACM
terms AI-drive scientific discovery as the 5th Paradigm. Reverse engineering research could be a 
real game-changer in establishing theories and conjectures. Ioannidis surmises: "Can we expect AI to transform
from a tool to an actual researcher itself, pose and investigate scientific hypotheses, and eventually write
papers about its work?" In otherwords, can AI become a peer for human in research and innovation? Can 
human peer-reviewers be able to even ask probing questions to evaluate AI-driven research?
