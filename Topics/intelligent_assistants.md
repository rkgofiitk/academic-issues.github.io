# AI Assistants in Research Innovation, a Reality

Many employ voice-based virtual assistant like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa and Google 
Assistant for various tasks such as setting alarms, reminders, and several context-aware conversational
commands like switching on gysers, shutting down air conditioner, preparing shopping lists, giving navigation
instruction to a self-driven vehicle, and so on.

Much of the stock market predictions are increasingly AI-based. There are many investment instruments like quant
fund that rely on machine learning prediction models for portfolio management. The quant fund managers boast
that investments in quant funds could generate returns in the range of 77-83% according to back testing
results. I am  unaware of checks and balances that SEBI has put in place to assure the investors that 
these AI-oriented, data-driven prediction models are not entirely misleading. 

Robotic surgery and applications of industrial robots have become quite well-established in precision
surgery and industrial manufacturing processes. Construction activities have become largely automated and 
Industry 4.0 is a reality even in heavy industries like steel macking. Bhilai steel plant's rail making process
is completely automated. We have reached the age of driverless cabs, trains and transportation
services. Most these activities are heavily sesnor-based and AI-driven.  

One can guess that the intelligent assistants may progressively graduate to become scientific research 
assistants with extension of AI-comfort in lessening human pains, suffering, travails and toils, Experimental
set ups are mostly handled by precision instruments and automation. 

The other aspect of research is literature survey, report writing and publication. Literature survey is 
now assisteed mostly by intelligent generative AI-based search assistants. Many have started relying

It will be interesting to surmise that in next few years much theoretical research would be AI-driven.

The year 2024's nobel prize in Physics has been awarded to Molecular Biologist John Hopfield and Computer Scientist.
Giffry Hinton for their "Foundational discoveries and innovations that enable machine learning with artifical
neural network." The heart of their research is AI-assisted. Likewise, Nobel prize and chemistry went
to David Baker, a Professor in Biochemistry and John Jumper, Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google Deepmind.
The citations refer to their research in "computational protein structure design" and  "protein structure prediction", 
respectively. Physicists and Chemists were predictably very upset. Yannis Ioannidis in an oped in CACM
terms AI-drive scientific discovery as the 5th Paradigm. Reverse engineering research could be a 
real game-changer in establishing theories and conjectures. Ioannidis surmises: "Can we expect AI to transform
from a tool to an actual researcher itself, pose and investigate scientific hypotheses, and eventually write
papers about its work?" In otherwords, can AI become a peer for human in research and innovation? Can 
human peer-reviewers be able to even ask probing questions to evaluate AI-driven research?
