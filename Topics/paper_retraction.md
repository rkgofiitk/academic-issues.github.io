# Nobel Retraction

Gregg Semenza, a Professor of Genetics at Johns Hopkins School of Medical Sciences, shared 2019 Nobel Prize for medicines with two other
scientists for their work in mRNA vaccine. Gregg studied medical genetics at Harvard before registering for PhD at the University
of Pensylvania. An introduction on illustrious background of Gregg Semenza is necessary for the readers to appreciate the importance of the 
topic of this blog. At the time of writing this blog Prof. Semenza has a list of 13 retractions to his credit. All retractions were 
multi-authored research papers published in reputed journals. Top in the list of journals is PNAS (Proceedings of National Acedemy
of Sciences) where four retractions were made in 2022. Together the four papers have been cited 750 times by other researchers. An
[investigation by Nature](https://www.the-scientist.com/nobel-prize-winner-faces-investigation-into-paper-integrity-70669)
found 17 papers co-authored by Gregg are retracted, corrected, or raised concerns regarding falsified data and conclusions. Most 
scientist believe that honest retractions are acceptable. However, there are some fundamental issues:
- What kind of gains accrued from publications to the authors of retracted papers.
- What percentage of retracted papers had falsified data and corrected to merit publication.
- How the retracted papers influenced other researchers to explore wrong direction and led to unproductive research engagements.

  One of the co-authors of Semenza is Naoki Mori. According to [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/2011/01/24/cracking-the-mori-case-a-reviewer-describes-how-manipulated-images-came-to-light/)
  Mori who specializes in cancer virus "publishes characteristically very weak papers." Retraction Watch had corresponded with one
  of the researchers who specializes in cancer virus and claimed to have reviewed  of Mori's paper.
