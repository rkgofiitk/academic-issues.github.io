# Sankhyar Gulpo: The Story of Numbers

Recently, I received an interesting piece of work as a gift. It is  a unique book in any vernacular language in India and 
is about an arid subject like mathematics. The author of the book [Prof Asok Mallik](https://fellows.ias.ac.in/profile/v/FL1997013)  was my colleague at IIT Kanpur in the 
Department of Mechanical Engineering. At IIT Kanpur, we had minimal interactions beyond occasional official meetings. However,
we had a chance to catch up on lost time during a small social gathering in Kolkata. Prof Mallik shared his wealth of experience
authoring books on Bengali mathematics. Since Prof Mallik is an outstanding teacher, I was curious to have a glimpse of his book 
on  Sankhyar Gulpo [^1] ("The Story of Numbers"). He was kind enough to send it as a gift. I also procured a copy of his other 
book "Geometry Beyond School Texts." Three of his mathematics books are in English and published by IISc Press.

The book I am reading now is a storehouse of knowledge on numbers. Starting with the origin of numbers, the book deals with 
Integers, Real Numbers, Complex Numbers and Special Numbers. As I said, I have yet to come across a comparable book in other
Indian languages that is meant for an audience of students about to graduate from school. 

Admittedly, Bengali is not my strongest point. However, I managed to review a major part of the book. The book also describes 
interesting anecdotes behind the numbers designed to leave a lasting imprint on the readers. It could be an excellent companion 
for nurturing a feel for numbers, their origin, and many interesting properties. It would also be a must-read for young students 
who wish to prepare for Maths Olympiad. Thank you, Prof Mallik, for authoring such a book. I don't know if Prof Mallik will 
appreciate the summary I presented here, but I take the liberty of his accommodating demeanor as a consent. 

Some of the interesting facts that the book deals with are the Origin of Natural Numbers, Integers, Rational and Irrational numbers. 
Knowing origins or the history behind how the number of systems evolved, a great learning experience that fulfills knowledge gaps
if one carefully goes through Prof Mallik's book. Let me describe a bit on certain parts of the book's content and that will 
explain why I recommend it strongly for senior school students, and graduating students of schools who may want to pursue a career
in science or engineering.

All of us know that the natural numbers originated from counting. However, the concept of length and its units originated from
geometry. The Hindu-Arab numeral system is augmented by the discovery of zero. Sridhara, the 9th-century Indian mathematician, 
contributed significantly by creating rules for computation involving zero. Who discovered zero, however, remains a mystery. 
The realization that the integral numbers system has no end led to the concept of $\infty$. The symbol $\infty$ is known as
lazy eight because it is not straight like the numeric symbol eight. It also represents a curve that one can traverse endlessly.
Cantor chose to represent $\infty$ as aleph zero ($\alep0$). 

The book's description of the geometric origin of numbers is particularly fascinating. Greeks did not have symbols for
numbers. They represented the numerical values of whole numbers by geometric formations of pebbles placed on the plane ground. 
We may visualize the placements of pebbles by drawing filled bubbles on paper. The Greek origin of numbers is based on geometry. 
There are two tools: (i) an unmarked straight edge (made most likely from wood) and (ii) a compass.Both the tools start with
the dimensionless concept of "point." Interestingly, despite having developed geometry around the idea of a point, the Greek
mathematician had no clue about zero. Straight edge and compass are the tools that connect two points. For example, the first 
tool joins two points on a plane, and the second tool joins one fixed point $c$ to all possible points at a fixed radial 
distance from $c$ defining a circle. Each point on a circle perimeter measures a radial length from the center point where 
one of the legs of the compass is fixed to produce the circle. So, the two ancient Greek tools measure length or represent 
a number. Varying the relative placement of points, Greek mathematicians conceptualized the existence of numbers. Rational
numbers are included in the Greek number system since any rational number can represent a measurable length. The existence 
of irrational numbers is also established by geometry when it is found that the hypotenuse of unit square if $\sqrt{2}$, and 
the hypotenuse of a regular unit pentagon is $\sqrt{5} + 1)/2$ The area of a circle is also a square of a number 
multiplied by an irrational number. Ancient Greek mathematicians refused to recognize any mathematical process without being
backed by geometric constructions. Greek mathematicians not only successfully classified the numbers but were able to 
establish algebraic identities like: 


  $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = (n+1)^2$$


The set of Integers is countably infinite. Integers are written using two different positional notations: (i) decimal or 
(ii) binary. However, mixed positional notations are also used. The Babylonian numeral system used sexagesimal notations. 
A clock's second hand traverses 360 degrees to complete a 1 minute, and the minute hand moves 360 degrees to clock an hour.
Interestingly, the hour hand moves 360 degrees to clock 24 hours, equivalent to one solar day. Earth has to rotate 361 degrees
for the Sun to pass through the meridian. A sidereal day is 4 minutes shorter than a solar day due to the extra degree of the 
Earth's rotation. A solar day is defined as the interval between two passing of the Sun over the meridian due to the 
Earth's rotation. Computers work with the presence or absence of a signal or an electric pulse. So, a binary number system 
is essential. However, we use hexadecimal (16) and octal (8) as shorthand for binary notation in computer programming.   

The most critical subset of Integers is Prime numbers. Researchers have invested a lot of time in unraveling the mystery of 
prime numbers. The book deals with interesting prime numbers, such as Euclidean Primes, Mersenne Primes, Fermats Primes, 
Pierpont Primes, Sophie Germain Primes, Pillai Primes, Ramanujan Primes, Twin Primes, etc. However, apart from research 
interests, the most critical application of prime numbers has been in secured Internet message transfer. A good grasp of prime
numbers and generating sequences of primes is advantageous. So, Prof Mallik's book gives students much-desired exposure to 
basic stuff. Besides prime numbers, the book deals with composite numbers. It provides an excellent insight into designing 
an iterative process of generating numbers useful for creating recursive programs. Reading the book, one will realize
the difference between an average and an outstanding teacher. We had excellent mathematics teachers, but none told us anything
remotely close to what Prof Mallik's book offers.


Chapter 3 of the book is on real numbers. This chapter is a treasure trove for people who want to study the behavior of real
numbers, sequences, and series of real numbers and functions. More precisely, such an understanding of real numbers would be 
very critical for precision in computations. Real numbers include rational, irrational, and transcendental numbers. The 
representation of rational numbers in terms of continued fraction has an Egyptian origin, where each fraction's numerator is 1.
Many simple patterns are detected expressing the constants like $\Pi$ and Neperian base <i>e</i> in terms of continued fractions. 
Of particular interest to computing and computer science students is the method of iteration in real numbers. Iteration is
one of the important mainstays for branches of mathematics like Calculus and Topology. Two different methods of finding the
positive square root of a number have been discussed. The book includes examples of flowers and fruit to establish
inspirational anecdotes from nature to the concept of the golden section. 

Leibniz describes imaginary numbers as "A wonderful refuge of the divine spirit as an amphibian between being and non-being." 
Chapter 4 of the book traces our earliest encounter with imaginary numbers in school algebra when solving quadratic equations. At
school, we only focused on solutions that produced real roots. The exercises are designed to carefully avoid the possibility of 
discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$ . However, the teachers did not tell us why. Let me share an anecdotal reference to negative discriminants.
We were upset that our mathematics teacher was transferred close to the school board examination. The new person who joined his 
place was also our principal, responsible for teaching us mathematics. A group of friends decided to put the principal in a spot
by formulating tricky problems and asking him for solutions. One such problem is where the discriminant was negative. 

Four special numbers, namely, hyperreal numbers, quaternions, dual numbers, and p-Adic numbers, are discussed in Chapter 5. 
Differential calculus starts infinitesimal (denoted by $\Delta$). It represents a classic case of many things mathematicians did 
right without inventing the basisâ€”the concept of infinitesimal 300 years after the invention of differential calculus. Abraham
Robinson used hyperreal numbers to establish the intuitive notion of infinitesimal. 

In a short review, I can't describe the way Prof Mallik narrated the story of numbers. It is like experiencing an aircraft 
pushback taxing on a runway and then to a final takeoff. For example, the book deals with complex numbers as a generalization 
of real numbers in which the coefficient of the imaginary part is 0. Then, it introduces Euler's exponential function, the 
fundamental theorem of algebra, the Rieman hypothesis, and fractals.
